\begin{abstract}
We present a free and open source implementation of the Finite Volume Method that captures thermal and solute-driven surface flows, more commonly known as Marangoni flows. The application is capable of performing adaptive mesh refinement in order to substantially save computational cost in multiphase flows where accurate tracking of the phase boundaries is crucial. We demonstrate our work by a simple two-dimensional benchmark case and outline possible applications with a mesoscopic model of Laser Powder Bed Fusion additive manufacturing.

\section{Introduction}
This document is a model and instructions for \LaTeX.
Please observe the conference page limits. 
\section{Theory}

The theory in this work relies on the Continuum Surface Stress Method initially presented by Lafaurie et al., extending the works on modelling surface tension with the Volume of Fluid Method as described by Brackbill et al. \cite{lafaurieModellingMergingFragmentation1994,brackbillContinuumMethodModeling1992}. This foundation is modified and implemented into the existing OpenFOAM solver \texttt{icoReactingMultiphaseInterFoam} based on Version 2106. The modifications rely on the works of Gueyffier et al. in order to account for the additional Marangoni stresses \cite{gueyffierVolumeofFluidInterfaceTracking1999}. The following presents a brief summary of the modelling involved.

To describe the necessary tensor algebra, we will use the index notation of tensors in a cartesic coordinate system alongside with the Einstein summation convention where the sum over matching indices is implied. First, the capillary stress tensor is introduced:

\begin{equation}
    T_{ij} = - \sigma \delta_s (\delta_{ij} - n_i n_j)
\end{equation}

Where $\sigma$ is the generally non constant coefficient of surface tension, $\delta_s$ is the interface delta function, $\delta_{ij}$ is the Kronecker Delta function and $n_i$ is the interface unit normal vector. The local coordinate system of the interface needs to be an orthogonal system in order to separate the purely geometry based capillary force and the tangential Marangoni forces.
The resulting force accounting for all surface tension effects can now be expressed as the divergence of the capillary stress tensor, yielding:

\begin{align}
    \frac{\partial T_{ij}}{\partial x_j} = \frac{\partial \sigma}{\partial x_j} [\delta_s(\delta_{ij} - n_i n_j)] + \frac{\partial \delta_s}{\partial x_j} [\sigma (\delta_{ij} - n_i n_j)] + \sigma \delta_s \frac{\partial}{\partial x_j} (\delta_{ij} - n_i n_j) \label{eq:stress-tensor}
\end{align}

One can show that Eq. \ref{eq:stress-tensor} can be re-arranged using some tensor algebra and geometric identities into a much shorter and more useful form. The derivation is given in more detail by Lafaurie et al. \cite{lafaurieModellingMergingFragmentation1994}. By performing those rearrangements, we can recover a form that separates the normal from the tangential components of the divergence vector:

\begin{equation}
    \frac{\partial T_{ij}}{\partial x_j} = \frac{\partial \sigma}{\partial x_i} [\delta_s(\delta_{ij} - n_i n_j)] - \sigma \kappa n_i \delta_s
\end{equation}

Here, the interface curvature $\kappa$ is introduced. The second term of the right hand side corresponds to the normal capillary force directed in the normal direction of the interface, effecting a contractional movement of the interface. The first term resembles the marangoni-type forces present. By taking the derivative of the surface tension coefficient, this term does not vanish iff there are gradients present at the interface. This is normally the case when there are multiple species involved or temperature gradients present \cite{j.straubThermokapillareGrenzflachenkonvektionGasblasen1990}. Note that we then simply evaluate the ordinary form of surface tension without any additional physics present. However, as the surface tension coefficient is otherwise not a direct local variable, one must further differentiate the term:

\begin{equation}
    \frac{\partial \sigma(c,T)}{\partial x_j} = \frac{\partial \sigma(c,T)}{\partial T} \frac{\partial T}{\partial x_j} + \frac{\partial \sigma(c,T)}{\partial c} \frac{\partial c}{\partial x_j}
    \label{eq:sigmadiff}
\end{equation}

Additionally, the delta function $\delta_s$ needs to be discretized in a suitable manner in order to capture the physics within the Finite Volume framework. This can be done using the Volume of Fluid Method by taking the gradient of the phase volume fraction $\alpha$ \cite{gueyffierVolumeofFluidInterfaceTracking1999,hirtVolumeFluidVOF1981}:

\begin{equation}
    \delta_s = \left\lvert \frac{\partial \alpha}{\partial x_i} \right\rvert
\end{equation}

The interface unit normal vector $n_i$ can be computed in a similar manner by using the previously computed interface function:

\begin{equation}
    n_i = \frac{1}{\delta_s} \frac{\partial \alpha}{\partial x_i}
\end{equation}

To perform the finite volume simulations, the Open Source C++ Library OpenFOAM is used in Version 2106. In order to accommodate the extended surface stress formulation, some of the existing solver capabilities need to be modified. The changes necessary are elaborated on in more detail in the following chapter

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Results}

\subsection{Implementation}

Our implementation of the thermo-fluid-dynamic model is based on the Open Source Software library OpenFOAM.
In our proposed implementation, we compute the local gradient of the surface tension explicitly, after it is evaluated for every cell. This means that the gradients with respect to temperature and species concentration are interpolated from the given material properties and the field derivatives are computed separately, unlike Eq. \ref{eq:sigmadiff} suggests.
As a result, the capillary stress is evaluated regardless of the type of Marangoni flow. That is, temperature as well as species gradients or in other effects causing spacial gradients are regarded in this model and contribute to a resulting tangential stress on the interface. Using this approach, the solver configuration remains flexible regarding the future implementation of other or different type physics. However, an appropriate modelling of the surface tension coefficient is required.

The proposed code computes the divergence of the capillary stress tensor for finite volume cell centers. However, to handle source terms within the PIMPLE loop, it is necessary to also supply the surface tension force as a scalar interpolated to the cell face. Therefore, an additional method is implemented that computes the $L_2$ norm of the surface tension force vector and interpolates the scalar value via finite differencing.

For powder bed fusion applications where large spacial temperature gradients in the order of \SI[per-mode=fraction]{1e7}{\kelvin \per \metre} can be present \cite{hooperMeltPoolTemperature2018}, it is advisable to use a second order accurate and stable discretisation scheme for the temperature flux, such as the already within OpenFOAM implemented TVD schemes minmod, superBee or vanLeer \cite{roeCharacteristicBasedSchemesEuler1986,vanleerUltimateConservativeDifference1974}.

In order to resolve the complex wetting phenomena and flow patterns in inhomogenous mixtures requires the modelling of several distinct phases. In our case for Ti6Al4V, this equates to a total of $3n +1 =10$ phases including the separate gaseous phase to model the shielding gas flow.

To account for thermal and solute-driven effects simultaneously, we need to incorporate the temperature dependence of the surface tension as well as interfacial tension between the alloying elements in the liquid state. This allows us to capture not only flow patterns on the liquid-gas interface, but also between liquid interfaces of dissimilar species. We may find accurate values for temperature dependent surface tension in the literature. However, determining interfacial tension poses a non-trivial problem that has been discussed in the literature \cite{marmurCorrelatingInterfacialTensions2010}.

Naturally, the occurence of interfaces between dissimilar metals is nothing unique to the setting of in-situ alloying. This effect should be observable in pre-alloyed powders as well and hence also play a role in Powder Bed Fusion processes in general. However, the mixing paths in this case will be in the range of less than the typical powder diameter and thus in the order of \SI[per-mode=fraction]{1e0}{\micro\metre} to \SI[per-mode=fraction]{10}{\micro\metre}. In-situ alloying however leads to a distribution of alloying species much further apart from each other, i.e. about 10x in comparison. This consequently increases the time the flow takes to homogeneize the melt notably and thus should not be considered instantaneous and hence neglected anymore.

In a pursuit to keep model evaluation simple and not rely on Molecular Dynamics calculations, we use the following, relatively simple approximation for interfacial tension given by Girifalco and Good \cite{girifalcoTheoryEstimationSurface1957}:

\begin{equation}
    \sigma_{1,2} = \sigma_1 + \sigma_1 + 2C (\sigma_1 \sigma_2)^{1/2}
\end{equation}

Here, $\sigma_{1,2}$ denotes the interfacial tension, $\sigma_1$ and $\sigma_2$ are the surface tensions of the involved species and $C$ is a constant which we assume to be unity as a reasonable approximation \cite{marmurCorrelatingInterfacialTensions2010}.
\section{Ease of Use}

\subsection{Maintaining the Integrity of the Specifications}

The IEEEtran class file is used to format your paper and style the text. All margins, 
column widths, line spaces, and text fonts are prescribed; please do not 
alter them. You may note peculiarities. For example, the head margin
measures proportionately more than is customary. This measurement 
and others are deliberate, using specifications that anticipate your paper 
as one part of the entire proceedings, and not as an independent document. 
Please do not revise any of the current designations.

\section{Prepare Your Paper Before Styling}
Before you begin to format your paper, first write and save the content as a 
separate text file. Complete all content and organizational editing before 
formatting. Please note sections \ref{AA}--\ref{SCM} below for more information on 
proofreading, spelling and grammar.

Keep your text and graphic files separate until after the text has been 
formatted and styled. Do not number text heads---{\LaTeX} will do that 
for you.

\subsection{Abbreviations and Acronyms}\label{AA}
Define abbreviations and acronyms the first time they are used in the text, 
even after they have been defined in the abstract. Abbreviations such as 
IEEE, SI, MKS, CGS, ac, dc, and rms do not have to be defined. Do not use 
abbreviations in the title or heads unless they are unavoidable.

\subsection{Units}
\begin{itemize}
\item Use either SI (MKS) or CGS as primary units. (SI units are encouraged.) English units may be used as secondary units (in parentheses). An exception would be the use of English units as identifiers in trade, such as ``3.5-inch disk drive''.
\item Avoid combining SI and CGS units, such as current in amperes and magnetic field in oersteds. This often leads to confusion because equations do not balance dimensionally. If you must use mixed units, clearly state the units for each quantity that you use in an equation.
\item Do not mix complete spellings and abbreviations of units: ``Wb/m\textsuperscript{2}'' or ``webers per square meter'', not ``webers/m\textsuperscript{2}''. Spell out units when they appear in text: ``. . . a few henries'', not ``. . . a few H''.
\item Use a zero before decimal points: ``0.25'', not ``.25''. Use ``cm\textsuperscript{3}'', not ``cc''.)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Equations}
Number equations consecutively. To make your 
equations more compact, you may use the solidus (~/~), the exp function, or 
appropriate exponents. Italicize Roman symbols for quantities and variables, 
but not Greek symbols. Use a long dash rather than a hyphen for a minus 
sign. Punctuate equations with commas or periods when they are part of a 
sentence, as in:
\begin{equation}
a+b=\gamma\label{eq}
\end{equation}

Be sure that the 
symbols in your equation have been defined before or immediately following 
the equation. Use ``\eqref{eq}'', not ``Eq.~\eqref{eq}'' or ``equation \eqref{eq}'', except at 
the beginning of a sentence: ``Equation \eqref{eq} is . . .''

\subsection{\LaTeX-Specific Advice}

Please use ``soft'' (e.g., \verb|\eqref{Eq}|) cross references instead
of ``hard'' references (e.g., \verb|(1)|). That will make it possible
to combine sections, add equations, or change the order of figures or
citations without having to go through the file line by line.

Please don't use the \verb|{eqnarray}| equation environment. Use
\verb|{align}| or \verb|{IEEEeqnarray}| instead. The \verb|{eqnarray}|
environment leaves unsightly spaces around relation symbols.

Please note that the \verb|{subequations}| environment in {\LaTeX}
will increment the main equation counter even when there are no
equation numbers displayed. If you forget that, you might write an
article in which the equation numbers skip from (17) to (20), causing
the copy editors to wonder if you've discovered a new method of
counting.

{\BibTeX} does not work by magic. It doesn't get the bibliographic
data from thin air but from .bib files. If you use {\BibTeX} to produce a
bibliography you must send the .bib files. 

{\LaTeX} can't read your mind. If you assign the same label to a
subsubsection and a table, you might find that Table I has been cross
referenced as Table IV-B3. 

{\LaTeX} does not have precognitive abilities. If you put a
\verb|\label| command before the command that updates the counter it's
supposed to be using, the label will pick up the last counter to be
cross referenced instead. In particular, a \verb|\label| command
should not go before the caption of a figure or a table.

Do not use \verb|\nonumber| inside the \verb|{array}| environment. It
will not stop equation numbers inside \verb|{array}| (there won't be
any anyway) and it might stop a wanted equation number in the
surrounding equation.

\subsection{Some Common Mistakes}\label{SCM}
\begin{itemize}
\item The word ``data'' is plural, not singular.
\item The subscript for the permeability of vacuum $\mu_{0}$, and other common scientific constants, is zero with subscript formatting, not a lowercase letter ``o''.
\item In American English, commas, semicolons, periods, question and exclamation marks are located within quotation marks only when a complete thought or name is cited, such as a title or full quotation. When quotation marks are used, instead of a bold or italic typeface, to highlight a word or phrase, punctuation should appear outside of the quotation marks. A parenthetical phrase or statement at the end of a sentence is punctuated outside of the closing parenthesis (like this). (A parenthetical sentence is punctuated within the parentheses.)
\item A graph within a graph is an ``inset'', not an ``insert''. The word alternatively is preferred to the word ``alternately'' (unless you really mean something that alternates).
\item Do not use the word ``essentially'' to mean ``approximately'' or ``effectively''.
\item In your paper title, if the words ``that uses'' can accurately replace the word ``using'', capitalize the ``u''; if not, keep using lower-cased.
\item Be aware of the different meanings of the homophones ``affect'' and ``effect'', ``complement'' and ``compliment'', ``discreet'' and ``discrete'', ``principal'' and ``principle''.
\item Do not confuse ``imply'' and ``infer''.
\item The prefix ``non'' is not a word; it should be joined to the word it modifies, usually without a hyphen.
\item There is no period after the ``et'' in the Latin abbreviation ``et al.''.
\item The abbreviation ``i.e.'' means ``that is'', and the abbreviation ``e.g.'' means ``for example''.
\end{itemize}
An excellent style manual for science writers is \cite{b7}.

\subsection{Authors and Affiliations}
\textbf{The class file is designed for, but not limited to, six authors.} A 
minimum of one author is required for all conference articles. Author names 
should be listed starting from left to right and then moving down to the 
next line. This is the author sequence that will be used in future citations 
and by indexing services. Names should not be listed in columns nor group by 
affiliation. Please keep your affiliations as succinct as possible (for 
example, do not differentiate among departments of the same organization).

\subsection{Identify the Headings}
Headings, or heads, are organizational devices that guide the reader through 
your paper. There are two types: component heads and text heads.

Component heads identify the different components of your paper and are not 
topically subordinate to each other. Examples include Acknowledgments and 
References and, for these, the correct style to use is ``Heading 5''. Use 
``figure caption'' for your Figure captions, and ``table head'' for your 
table title. Run-in heads, such as ``Abstract'', will require you to apply a 
style (in this case, italic) in addition to the style provided by the drop 
down menu to differentiate the head from the text.

Text heads organize the topics on a relational, hierarchical basis. For 
example, the paper title is the primary text head because all subsequent 
material relates and elaborates on this one topic. If there are two or more 
sub-topics, the next level head (uppercase Roman numerals) should be used 
and, conversely, if there are not at least two sub-topics, then no subheads 
should be introduced.

\subsection{Figures and Tables}
\paragraph{Positioning Figures and Tables} Place figures and tables at the top and 
bottom of columns. Avoid placing them in the middle of columns. Large 
figures and tables may span across both columns. Figure captions should be 
below the figures; table heads should appear above the tables. Insert 
figures and tables after they are cited in the text. Use the abbreviation 
``Fig.~\ref{fig}'', even at the beginning of a sentence.

\begin{table}[htbp]
\caption{Table Type Styles}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
\textbf{Table}&\multicolumn{3}{|c|}{\textbf{Table Column Head}} \\
\cline{2-4} 
\textbf{Head} & \textbf{\textit{Table column subhead}}& \textbf{\textit{Subhead}}& \textbf{\textit{Subhead}} \\
\hline

\end{center}
\end{table}

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centerline{\includegraphics{fig1.png}}
\caption{Example of a figure caption.}
\label{fig}
\end{figure}

Figure Labels: Use 8 point Times New Roman for Figure labels. Use words 
rather than symbols or abbreviations when writing Figure axis labels to 
avoid confusing the reader. As an example, write the quantity 
``Magnetization'', or ``Magnetization, M'', not just ``M''. If including 
units in the label, present them within parentheses. Do not label axes only 
with units. In the example, write ``Magnetization (A/m)'' or ``Magnetization 
\{A[m(1)]\}'', not just ``A/m''. Do not label axes with a ratio of 
quantities and units. For example, write ``Temperature (K)'', not 
``Temperature/K''.

\section*{Acknowledgment}

The preferred spelling of the word ``acknowledgment'' in America is without 
an ``e'' after the ``g''. Avoid the stilted expression ``one of us (R. B. 
G.) thanks $\ldots$''. Instead, try ``R. B. G. thanks$\ldots$''. Put sponsor 
acknowledgments in the unnumbered footnote on the first page.

\section*{References}

Please number citations consecutively within brackets \cite{b1}. The 
sentence punctuation follows the bracket \cite{b2}. Refer simply to the reference 
number, as in \cite{b3}---do not use ``Ref. \cite{b3}'' or ``reference \cite{b3}'' except at 
the beginning of a sentence: ``Reference \cite{b3} was the first $\ldots$''

Number footnotes separately in superscripts. Place the actual footnote at 
the bottom of the column in which it was cited. Do not put footnotes in the 
abstract or reference list. Use letters for table footnotes.

Unless there are six authors or more give all authors' names; do not use 
``et al.''. Papers that have not been published, even if they have been 
submitted for publication, should be cited as ``unpublished'' \cite{b4}. Papers 
that have been accepted for publication should be cited as ``in press'' \cite{b5}. 
Capitalize only the first word in a paper title, except for proper nouns and 
element symbols.

For papers published in translation journals, please give the English 
citation first, followed by the original foreign-language citation \cite{b6}.
