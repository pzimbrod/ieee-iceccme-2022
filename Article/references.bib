  abstract = {This paper describes how Marangoni flows of various forms can be generated in thin liquid films for the purposes of microfluidic manipulation. Several microfluidic components, including traps, channels, filters and pumps, for manipulating aqueous droplets suspended in a film of oil on blank, unpatterned substrates are demonstrated. These are `virtual' devices because they have no physical structure; they accomplish their function entirely by localized variations in surface tension (Marangoni flows) created in a non-contact manner by heat sources suspended just above the liquid surface. Various flow patterns can be engineered through the geometric design of the heat sources on size scales ranging from 10 to 1000 \textmu m. A point source generates toroidal flows which can be used for droplet merging and mixing. Virtual channels and traps, emulated by linear and annular heat fluxes, respectively, demonstrate nearly 100\% size selectivity for droplets ranging from 300 to 1000 \textmu m. A source of heat flux that is parallel to the surface and is triangular with a 10\textdegree{} taper serves as a linear pump, translating droplets of about the same size at speeds up to 200 \textmu m s-1. The paper includes simulations that illuminate the working principle of the devices. Models show that Marangoni flows scale favorably to small length scales. By using microscale thermal devices delivering sharp temperature gradients, it is possible to generate mm s-1 flow velocities with only small increases ({$<$}1\textdegree ) in liquid temperature.},

  abstract = {A new method for modeling surface tension effects on fluid motion has been developed. Interfaces between fluids of different properties, or ``colors,'' are represented as transition regions of finite thickness, across which the color variable varies continuously. At each point in the transition region, a force density is defined which is proportional to the curvature of the surface of constant color at that point. It is normalized so that the conventional description of surface tension on an interface is recovered when the ratio of local transition region thickness to local radius of curvature approaches zero. The continuum method eliminates the need for interface reconstruction, simplifies the calculation of surface tension, enables accurate modeling of two- and three-dimensional fluid flows driven by surface forces, and does not impose any modeling restrictions on the number, complexity, or dynamic evolution of fluid interfaces having surface tension. Computational results for two-dimensional flows are given to illustrate the properties of the method.},

  abstract = {This paper aims to develop a high-efficient finite element (FE) model by combining the equivalent boundary condition method (EBCM) and dynamic mesh method (DMM) for accelerating the thermo-mechanical simulation of additive manufacturing by powder bed fusion (PBF). EBCM and DMM take advantage of the strong non-linear phenomenon in the thermo-mechanical affected zone (TMAZ) by simplifying the temperature boundary conditions and optimizing the local mesh density, respectively. In detail, EBCM can reduce the difficulty of convergence in computing, while DMM can reduce the scale of stiffness matrix. The experimentally calibrated lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) firstly is used to produce the equivalent temperature function in TMAZ as the thermal input conditions of the FE model. The thermo- mechanical responses of several PBF deposits under different process parameters are predicted by the developed model, presenting good agreement with experiment data in terms of in-situ temperature and residual stress. Compared with the normal model, the novel high-efficient model notoriously cuts the computation cost without compromising precision. This study provides an important simulation concept for high-efficient FE analyses with high fidelity of the AM technology.},

The Marangoni convection is caused by a negative temperature gradient from the upper to the lower copper plug, whose diameter is kept to a small magnitude of 3 mm {$\Phi$} to obtain a small Bond's number. By this way the micro-gravity effect in respect to the Marangoni convection can be simulated. From the visualization and the simultaneous measurements of the local temperature the range of the Marangoni number for the transition is determined. A strong correlation exists between the observed period of the oscillation of the branching streamline between the two vortices on the plane with the axis of the floating zone on one hand and the period of the temperature oscillation on the other hand. A model conception for the physical mechanism is introduced to understand this oscillatory instability.},

  abstract = {A model for coupled radiation transfer and thermal diffusion is proposed, which provides a local temperature field. Single-line scanning of a laser beam over a thin layer of metallic powder placed on a dense substrate of the same material is studied. Both the laser beam diameter and the layer thickness are about 50\hspace{0.6em}{$\mu$}m. The typical scanning velocity is in the range of 10\textendash 20 cm/s. An effective volumetric heat source is estimated from laser radiation scattering and absorption in a powder layer. A strong difference in thermal conductivity between the powder bed and dense material is taken into account. The above conditions correspond to the technology of selective laser melting that is applied to build objects of complicated shape from metallic powder. Complete remelting of the powder in the scanned zone and its good adhesion to the substrate ensure fabrication of functional parts with mechanical properties close to the ones of the wrought material. Experiments with single-line melting indicate that an interval of scanning velocities exists, where the remelted tracks are uniform. The tracks become ``broken'' if the scanning velocity is outside this interval. This is extremely undesirable and referred to as the ``balling'' effect. The size and the shape of the melt pool and the surface of the metallurgical contact of the remelted material to the substrate are analyzed in relation to the scanning velocity. The modeling results are compared with experimental observation of laser tracks. The experimentally found balling effect at scanning velocities above {$\sim$}20\hspace{0.6em}cm/s can be explained by the Plateau\textendash Rayleigh capillary instability of the melt pool. Two factors destabilize the process with increasing the scanning velocity: increasing the length-to-width ratio of the melt pool and decreasing the width of its contact with the substrate.},

  abstract = {This paper reviews the past and recent studies on thermocapillarity in relation to microfluidics. The role of thermocapillarity as the change of surface tension due to temperature gradient in developing Marangoni flow in liquid films and conclusively bubble and drop actuation is discussed. The thermocapillary-driven mass transfer (the so-called Benard-Marangoni effect) can be observed in liquid films, reservoirs, bubbles and droplets that are subject to the temperature gradient. Since the contribution of a surface tension-driven flow becomes more prominent when the scale becomes smaller as compared to a pressure-driven flow, microfluidic applications based on thermocapillary effect are gaining attentions recently. The effect of thermocapillarity on the flow pattern inside liquid films is the initial focus of this review. Analysis of the relation between evaporation and thermocapillary instability approves the effect of Marangoni flow on flow field inside the drop and its evaporation rate. The effect of thermocapillary on producing Marangoni flow inside drops and liquid films, leads to actuation of drops and bubbles due to the drag at the interface, mass conservation, and also gravity and buoyancy in vertical motion. This motion can happen inside microchannels with a closed multiphase medium, on the solid substrate as in solid/liquid interaction, or on top of a carrier liquid film in open microfluidic systems. Various thermocapillary-based microfluidic devices have been proposed and developed for different purposes such as actuation, sensing, trapping, sorting, mixing, chemical reaction, and biological assays throughout the years. A list of the thermocapillary based microfluidic devices along with their characteristics, configurations, limitations, and improvements are presented in this review.},

Moreover, solving inverse problems with hidden physics is often prohibitively expensive and requires different formulations and elaborate computer codes. Machine learning has emerged as a promising alternative, but training deep neural networks requires big data, not always available for scientific problems. Instead, such networks can be trained from additional information obtained by enforcing the physical laws (for example, at random points in the continuous space-time domain). Such physics-informed learning integrates (noisy) data and mathematical models, and implements them through neural networks or other kernel-based regression networks. Moreover, it may be possible to design specialized network architectures that automatically satisfy some of the physical invariants for better accuracy, faster training and improved generalization. Here, we review some of the prevailing trends in embedding physics into machine learning, present some of the current capabilities and limitations and discuss diverse applications of physics-informed learning both for forward and inverse problems, including discovering hidden physics and tackling high-dimensional problems.},

Since synthesizing of such powders is complicated and expensive, an issue of in-situ processing becomes relevant and is increasingly studied nowadays. The main idea of in-situ alloying assisted processing, namely the alloying/reaction occurring between materials of different powders, can be implemented at three principally separate processing stages: pre-processing (raw material preparation), printing itself and post-processing (sintering/infiltration/heat-treatment). The presented brief review gives a necessary background for in-situ alloying at the mostly employed pre-process, process and post-process stages relevant for Powder Bed Fusion (PBF), Direct Energy Deposition (DED) and Binder Jet Printing (BJP) technologies. The presented survey discusses the involved physical processes with their relevance for each mentioned AM technologies and proposes a novel methodology for designing new materials.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a novel approach to numerical modelling of selective laser melting (SLM) processes characterized by melting and solidification of the deposited particulate material. The approach is based entirely on two homogeneous methods, such as cellular automata and Lattice Boltzmann. The model components operate in the common domain allowing for linking them into a more complex holistic numerical model with the possibility to complete full-scale calculations eliminating complicated interfaces. Several physical events, occurring in sequence or simultaneously, are currently considered including powder bed deposition, laser energy absorption and heating of the powder bed by the moving laser beam leading to powder melting, fluid flow in the melted pool, flow through partly or not melted materials and solidification. The possibilities and benefits of the proposed solution are demonstrated through a series of benchmark cases, as well as model verifications. The presented case studies deal mainly with melting and solidification of the powder bed including the free surface flow, wettability, and surface tension. An example of process simulation shows that the approach is generic and can be applied to different multi-material SLM processes, where energy transfer including solid\textendash liquid phase transformation is essential, by integrating the developed models within the proposed framework.},

  abstract = {We introduce a new numerical method, called "SURFER," for the simulation of two- and three-dimensional flows with several fluid phases and free interfaces between them. We consider incompressible fluids obeying the Navier-Stokes equation with Newtonian viscosity in the bulk of each phase. Capillary forces are taken into account even when interfaces merge or break up. Fluid interfaces are advanced in time using an exactly volume conserving variant of the volume of fluid algorithm, thus allowing for full symmetry between fluid phases. The Navier-Stokes equation is solved using staggered finite differences on a MAC grid and a split-explicit time differencing scheme, while incompressibility is enforced using an iterative multigrid Poisson solver. Capillary effects are represented as a stress tensor computed from gradients of the volume fraction function. This formulation is completely independent of the topology of interfaces and relatively easy to implement in 3D. It also allows exact momentum conservation in the discretized algorithm. Numerical spurious effects or "parasite currents" are noticed and compared to similar effects in Boltzmann lattice gas methods for immiscible fluids. Simulations of droplets pairs colliding in 2D and in 3D are shown. Interface reconnection is performed easily, despite the large value of capillary forces during reconnection.},

  abstract = {The classical development of neural networks has primarily focused on learning mappings between finite-dimensional Euclidean spaces. Recently, this has been generalized to neural operators that learn mappings between function spaces. For partial differential equations (PDEs), neural operators directly learn the mapping from any functional parametric dependence to the solution. Thus, they learn an entire family of PDEs, in contrast to classical methods which solve one instance of the equation. In this work, we formulate a new neural operator by parameterizing the integral kernel directly in Fourier space, allowing for an expressive and efficient architecture. We perform experiments on Burgers' equation, Darcy flow, and Navier-Stokes equation. The Fourier neural operator is the first ML-based method to successfully model turbulent flows with zero-shot super-resolution. It is up to three orders of magnitude faster compared to traditional PDE solvers. Additionally, it achieves superior accuracy compared to previous learning-based solvers under fixed resolution.},

  abstract = {Stationary welds of sodium nitrate (NaNO3, a high-Prandtl-number material) and gallium (Ga, a low-melting-point, low-Prandtl-number material) were made with a defocused CO2 laser beam to simulate the effect of Marangoni convection on the shape of arc weld pools without a surface-active agent. A Peclet number representing the ratio of (heat transport by convection)/(heat transport by conduction) was defined as Pe = LV/{$\alpha$}, where L is the pool surface radius, V the maximum outward surface velocity and {$\alpha$} the thermal diffusivity. The Ga and NaNO3 pools represented the low and high extremes of Pe, respectively, with commonly welded metals such as aluminum, steel and stainless steel falling in between. By going to these extremes, the effect of convection on the pool shape could be much more easily understood. For Ga, Pe was low because low V (weak Marangoni convection) and high {$\alpha$} promoted conduction down into the pool, and the resultant pool bottom was concave. For NaNO3, however, Pe became high easily because high V (strong Marangoni convection) and very low {$\alpha$} promoted outward convective heat transport, and the resultant pool bottom was shallow and flat. Reducing the beam diameter further increased V (even stronger Marangoni convection) and Pe. The fast outward surface flow turned and penetrated downward at the pool edge, resulting in a convex pool bottom. Both the flat and convex pool bottoms are a clear indication Marangoni convection dominated over gravity-induced buoyancy convection. It is proposed that, in the absence of both a surface-active agent and a significant electromagnetic force, the pool bottom convexity increases with increasing Pe. It was shown that, for a given material composition and welding process, the weld shape often reveals a good deal about the nature of weld pool convection.},

  abstract = {A transparent pool of NaNO3 (10 mm in diameter) was heated with a defocused CO2 laser beam to simulate Marangoni convection in arc weld pools without a surface-active agent. The flow patternswere revealed clearly by flow visualization with a laser light-cut technique, the surface temperature profiles were measured immediately below the pool surface, and a device for measuring the beam diameter was developed. The observed Marangoni convection was expected to resemble that in welding because the Marangoni number was close to those in welding. Two counterrotating cells were observed in the meridian plane of the pool. The maximum velocity was at the pool surface, the outward surface flow was much faster than the inward return flow and the centers of the cells were near the pool edge. These characteristics suggest Marangoni convection dominates in the pool over gravity-induced convection. Increasing the beam power (from 0.5 to 5.4 W) and reducing the beam diameter (from 5.9 to 1.5 mm) both made Marangoni convection stronger. The latter, however, had a significantly greater effect; the surface flow wasso much stronger asto make the return flow penetrate deeper into the pool. The results of physical simulation provided interesting insights for understanding the significant effect of Marangoni convection on the weld pool shape, as will be presented in a followup report.},

  abstract = {While it is widely known that neural networks are universal approximators of continuous functions, a less known and perhaps more powerful result is that a neural network with a single hidden layer can approximate accurately any nonlinear continuous operator. This universal approximation theorem is suggestive of the potential application of neural networks in learning nonlinear operators from data. However, the theorem guarantees only a small approximation error for a sufficient large network, and does not consider the important optimization and generalization errors. To realize this theorem in practice, we propose deep operator networks (DeepONets) to learn operators accurately and efficiently from a relatively small dataset. A DeepONet consists of two sub-networks, one for encoding the input function at a fixed number of sensors \$x\_i, i=1,\textbackslash dots,m\$ (branch net), and another for encoding the locations for the output functions (trunk net). We perform systematic simulations for identifying two types of operators, i.e., dynamic systems and partial differential equations, and demonstrate that DeepONet significantly reduces the generalization error compared to the fully-connected networks. We also derive theoretically the dependence of the approximation error in terms of the number of sensors (where the input function is defined) as well as the input function type, and we verify the theorem with computational results. More importantly, we observe high-order error convergence in our computational tests, namely polynomial rates (from half order to fourth order) and even exponential convergence with respect to the training dataset size.},

  abstract = {A numerical method for direct simulation of thermal Marangoni effects at dynamically deformable interface of two-phase incompressible fluids is developed. The approach is based on the Volume of Fluid (VOF) method with special focus on the numerical treatment of the temperature surface gradient because of its decisive role as the driving force of the flow. The surface gradient calculation is split into computing its length and direction in order to satisfy the correct thermal boundary condition at the interface without losing mobility of the interface. The method is applied to three different types of thermocapillary flow, namely thermocapillary migration of a droplet in an ambient fluid with linear temperature gradient, thermocapillary convection in a liquid layer under linear temperature gradient along the interface, and Marangoni convection due to B\'enard\textendash Marangoni instability. In the first case, different aspects of the dynamics of the migration are considered for validation such as the terminal migration velocity, the initial acceleration and quantification of the wall effects. The simulation also considers high convective heat transfer and covers a wide range of Marangoni numbers up to 5000, where good agreement with both theoretical and experimental results is achieved. In the second case, the convection velocity in the liquid layer is compared with an analytical result. In the final application, pattern formation due to the B\'enard\textendash Marangoni instability in a liquid layer in square geometry of small aspect ratio is investigated for realistic Biot number and dynamically deformable fluid interface. The results show good agreement with experiments from literature, where our numerical simulation also predicts cell pattern for a particular aspect ratio which is outside the limitation of the above cited experimental work.},

Widespread adoption of it and similar additive technologies is hampered by poor understanding of laser-metal interactions under such extreme thermal regimes. Here, we elucidate the mechanism of pore formation and liquid-solid interface dynamics during typical laser powder bed fusion conditions using in situ X-ray imaging and multi-physics simulations. Pores are revealed to form during changes in laser scan velocity due to the rapid formation then collapse of deep keyhole depressions in the surface which traps inert shielding gas in the solidifying metal. We develop a universal mitigation strategy which eliminates this pore formation process and improves the geometric quality of melt tracks. Our results provide insight into the physics of laser-metal interaction and demonstrate the potential for science-based approaches to improve confidence in components produced by laser powder bed fusion.},

Next to the vortex, depleted volumes appear that are entirely cleared of particles. This particle redistribution is caused by collisions of the tracers with the meniscus, which push the particles back onto the critical streamline with one particle radius distance to the meniscus. The streamlines between the meniscus and the critical streamline feed the depleted regions. Since the critical streamline depends on the particle radius, the effect leads to a particle fractionation according to their size. Diffusion allows only small particles to escape from the trap. Larger particles are permanently confined and their diffusion is rectified after every revolution at the meniscus, which produces a ratchet effect and increases the particle localization within the vortex.},

Using pure liquid as working fluid in this study, the phenomena of Marangoni symmetry-to-asymmetry transition which does not arise from the buoyancy was observed. The experiments used a vertical cylindrical channel and the meniscus was formed at the bottom outlet to minimize the buoyant influences. Two microscopes were used to have top view and side view of the meniscus simultaneously. The Marangoni flow field on the meniscus was obtained by means of tracing particles. It was observed that the Marangoni flow on a concave meniscus was always nearly symmetrical, while that on a convex meniscus was out of symmetry with only one single vortex occupying the whole channel. The experimental results were highly consistent to the simulation results of authors' previous 3D numerical model (Pan and Wang in Microfluid Nanofluid 9:657, 2010). Theoretical analysis together with newly developed numerical models is employed to dig into the mechanisms. The inward (from the meniscus edge to the center) Marangoni flow is found not as stable as the outward one. Based on the heat transfer analysis, a concave meniscus always has a colder edge thus the flow is outward and stable; while a convex enough meniscus could have an inward flow thus not stable and tends to lose the symmetry. The amplification mechanism of the inward Marangoni flow is comprehensively explained. Two conditions are required for the inward flow to lose the symmetry, i.e., the bulk liquid must be warmer than the meniscus, and the Marangoni number must be above a certain small value.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a study of the convection in acetone due jointly to the thermocapillary (Marangoni) and thermogravitational effects. The liquid (acetone) is submitted to a horizontal temperature difference. Experiments and numerical simulations both show the existence of three different states: monocellular steady states, multicellular steady states and spatio-temporal structures. The results are discussed and compared with the linear stability analysis of Smith \& Davis (1983).},

  abstract = {Powder Bed Fusion of Metals using a Laser Beam (PBF-LB/M) is increasingly utilized for the fabrication of complex parts in various industrial sectors. Enabling a robust and reproducible manufacturing process is one of the main goals in view of the future success of PBF-LB/M. To meet these challenges, alloys that are specifically adapted to the process are required. This paper demonstrates the successful interplay of simulation studies with experimental data to analyze the basic phenomena of in situ alloying. The meshless Smoothed-Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) method was employed for the numerical simulation of two-component powder systems considering both thermodynamics and fluid mechanics in the solid and the melt phase. The simulation results for the in situ alloying of stainless steel 316L blended with the aluminum alloy AlSi10Mg were enriched and validated with the data from a novel experimental test bench. The combination of both approaches can enhance the understanding of the process for in situ alloying. Therefore, future investigations of the PBF-LB/M process with multi-component powder systems can benefit from detailed numerical studies using SPH.},

  abstract = {A longstanding challenge is to optimize additive manufacturing (AM) process in order to reduce AM component failure due to excessive distortion and cracking. To address this challenge, a multi-scale physics-based modeling framework is presented to understand the interrelationship between AM processing parameters and resulting properties. In particular, a multi-scale approach, spanning from atomic, particle, to component levels, is employed. The simulations of sintered material show that sintered particles have lower mechanical strengths than the bulk metal because of their porous structures. Higher heating rate leads to a higher mechanical strength due to accelerated sintering rates. The average temperature in the powder bed increases with higher laser power. The predicted distortion due to residual stress in the AM fabricated component is in good agreement with experimental measurements. In summary, the model framework provides a design tool to optimize the metal powder based additive manufacturing process.},
