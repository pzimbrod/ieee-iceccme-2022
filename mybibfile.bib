  abstract = {A novel idea to create new alloys for Additive manufacturing (AM) by mixing a small addition of nanoparticles with bulk material was put forward. Integrated Computational Material Engineering (ICME) may be used to guide the AM process, predict thermal behaviour, optimize process parameters, secure net-shape, and qualify parts. Modelling is needed to predict the effect of defects and the effect of inclusions on mechanical properties, build quality and in-service performance. ICME can reduce trial-and-error fabrication and establish an AM digital twin, thereby accelerating part qualification and AM adoption. AM creates complex thermal processes which impact material microstructure and result in changes to mechanical properties in terms of strength and plasticity. In this study, Grain-Boundary Engineering (GBE) and multi-scale modelling are performed to expedite qualification of new and existing AM polycrystalline alloys. AM parts exhibit cracks, low toughness, low plasticity, and high residual stresses. To mitigate these characteristics, a methodology for GBE and microstructural control was developed. Depending on part requirements a low angle, coincident site lattice, or high angle grain boundary (LAGB,CSL, HAGB) might be the preferred option. For example, HAGB occurs in equiaxed grain microstructure, prevents precipitation and crystallization formation, and inhibits cracks and corrosion. Some polycrystalline materials may be non-weldable and exhibit cracks. Microstructural control can be used to address this phenomenon. AM offers unique advantages over casting, including material composition change and unique thermal processing. By utilizing nano-inclusions, cracks may be mitigated and AM parts improved. ICME physics-based approach is used to implement GBE modelling to improve the microstructure of an AM polycrystalline material from Equiaxed/HAGB to LAGB and CSL considering nano-scale inclusions. The ICME tool integrates meltpool engineering; thermal transport; nano-micro-mechanics; material characterization; calibration and qualification; Voronoi-tessellation, finite element modelling, and design of experiment optimization. With this background, ICME predicts time-temperature transformation, thermal properties, process map, meltpool size, precipitation, porosity, and effects of nano inclusions. In this manner, ICME helps determine ideal AM machine parameters that secure qualified parts as a consequence of the AM process. In this study, mechanical properties and fracture toughness were validated against test. Predictions included creep, crack growth, and the effect of precipitates and voids under in-service crack growth behaviour. Stainless steel (SS316L) dog bones specimens were printed and stress relieved by air and water cooling supported by fractography and imaging. The objective of this effort was to develop technologies and processes in AM design and engineering that could predetermine the microstructure of AM parts. Future efforts will employ the tool to tailor grain boundaries to produce predictable mechanical properties - including mode of failure.},

  abstract = {Additive manufacturing (AM) processes are receiving widespread attention due to the ability to create or repair precision engineering components without use of any die or mold. Currently, the approach to obtain a specific user defined/as-desired or conformal/epitaxial microstructure is a challenging and expensive iterative process. Modeling and validation of solidification microstructure can be leveraged to reduce iteration cost in obtaining a desired microstructure. Numerical Volume-of-fluid based method incorporating Marangoni convection can accurately predict the resultant melt pool geometry and temperature distribution which can serve as an input in prediction of microstructure evolution in solidifying mushy region. Hence, in the present study, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis is used to predict melt pool characteristics and phase field modeling is employed to simulate microstructure evolution in the as-deposited state for laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) process. Different features of LPBF microstructure such as segregation of secondary elements, dendrite sizes, dendritic orientation, dendritic morphology, and surface roughness are investigated and validated through comparison with experimental results. Phase-field model suggests strong dependency of dendrite orientation on surface roughness and scan speed and suggests potential of columnar flip or oriented-to-misoriented transition at higher scan speed. Segregation of the secondary elements is found to be the dominant factor in resultant dendrite width in the range of 1\textendash 3 {$\mu$}m. Furthermore, the developed method can easily be extended to predict the change in orientation of dendrites as new layers are built atop previous layers.},

  abstract = {Powder bed fusion (PBF) is an additive manufacturing (AM) process, which allows manufacturing of components that have been traditionally fabricated as a subassembly using formative and subtractive processes. This reduction of parts can aid to fast-track qualification programs. The PBF process is akin to welding since individual tracks are build-up near and on top of one another. It is therefore expected that alloys for PBF exhibit good weldability (or printability), which is a compound attribute of an alloy's response to given processing conditions. However, numerous industrial relevant alloys are not weldable. Assessing an alloy printability along with other material properties, require experimental testing. Presently, a purely modelling-based approach to select best-performing alloys is beyond reach. Various experimental approaches to rapid alloy design and screening have been reported in AM-literature, which fail to mimic the PBF process conditions entirely. This paper presents a targeted approach and methodology dedicated to novel alloy development for additive manufacturing (NADFAM) and its technical implementation for PBF. The NADFAM approach was applied for a case study featuring the selection of a best-performing titanium alloy for PBF manufacturing of load-bearing biomedical implants. Multiple criteria decision analysis (MCDA) tools were used to rank promising alloys and establish the most suitable to the process and the targeted application.},

The approach is applied to powder-bed selective laser melting (SLM) and validated, where the mechanical behaviour of macro-scale industrial components has been predicted and compared with experimental results. The novelty of the approach is based on using a calibrated analytical thermal model to derive functions that are implemented in a structural finite element analysis (FEA). The computational time for a complete analysis has been reduced from many days to less than three hours for a 3D blade component with a height of 80mm. The induced distortion in SLM has been compensated for by modifying the initial geometry using FE predicted distortion. A newly developed distortion compensation method, based on optical 3D scan measurements, has also been implemented. The two distortion compensation methods have been experimentally validated. In summary, the research presented in this paper shows that the mitigation of distortion in SLM is now possible on industrial macro-scale components.},

The efficiency lies in reducing the computational effort via spatial adaptivity, for which a dynamic particle refinement pattern with an optimized neighbor-search algorithm is used. The melt pool dynamics is modeled by resolving the thermal, mechanical, and material fields in a single laser track application. After validating the solver by two benchmark tests where analytical and experimental data are available, we simulate a single-track LPBF process by adopting SPH in multi resolutions. The LPBF simulation results show that the proposed adaptive refinement with and without an optimized neighbor-search approach saves almost 50\% and 35\% of the SPH calculation time, respectively. This achievement enables several opportunities for parametric studies and running high-resolution models with less computational effort.},

As the numerical solvers and problem complexity are evolving, the parallel computing facilities are also growing. This research study deals with the use of four different schemes to parallelly compute the numerical flow equations based on the finite volume method. The different schemes proposed are applied for parallelization using central processing units and graphical processing units. Open multiprocessing (OpenMP) and compute unified device architecture (CUDA) are the parallel computing tools used for parallelization of the code applying four schemes, viz. red and black successive over-relaxation (RBSOR), wavefront, combined RBSOR and wavefront, and alternate RBSOR and wavefront scheme. The flow analysis is carried out for internal and external flow at different Reynolds numbers on dissimilar machines having their individual computational capability. Speedup obtained and parallel efficiency achieved using the proposed unusual parallelization method are investigated separately. The grid size for both the flow conditions is fixed during the parallel computation performance analysis. The RBSOR scheme provided the maximum speedup in all cases of flow, scheme, and tool used. The wavefront scheme provides the lowest speedup and parallel efficiency. The alternate scheme is better than the wavefront scheme and combined scheme using OpenMP. The speedup achieved and parallel efficiency obtained for the CUDA parallelized code are in the range of 200\,\texttimes\,and 70\%, respectively, applying the RBSOR scheme.},

  abstract = {High speed imaging of molten pool free-surface hydrodynamics in laser-assisted directed energy deposition process clearly revealed a highly oscillatory and dynamic melt flow due to impinging powder particles. Surprisingly, most of the reported computational work exclude the injection of powder particles and rather adopt a homogeneous mass and energy addition approach, and therefore provides less accurate predictions. In this work, we develop a coupled multi-physics particle-scale approach utilizing the discrete element method for particle trajectory prediction, the computational fluid dynamics for free-surface thermo-fluidic modelling and the cellular automata method for grain growth evolution. In the model, the governing physical phenomena, such as laser-powder interaction, in-flight particle heating, phase change (melting, vaporization and solidification), free-surface evolution, molten pool hydrodynamics and impinging particles-melt interaction have been considered. Experiments for the deposition of Inconel-625 on an Inconel-625 substrate are carried out, and the model predictions are validated with the experimental measurements. For the first time, the predicted thermo-fluidic simulation results reveal highly oscillatory, chaotic and random melt flow attributed to the impinging powder particles. During the deposition, it is found that the role of the Marangoni convection is less significant as compared to the momentum imparted by the impinging powder particles in the melt pool. Using the simulated thermal undercooling data, cellular automata-based grain growth simulation predicts elongated columnar dendrites in the melt pool that grows epitaxially from the melt pool interface and stretches towards the centre. Using the Kurz-Fisher model, the effect of local thermodynamic solidification conditions on the size of dendritic microstructure is also described. The predicted melt pool geometry, temperature field and grain structure compare well with the experimental measurements.},

Further, the stochastic nature of defects in laser-powder bed fusion (L-PBF) make it difficult to predict the fatigue life in these components. In this work, we explored exceptional work hardening (WH) of a metastable Fe40Mn20Co20Cr15Si5 high entropy alloy (CS-HEA) to obtain high fatigue-resistance with L-PBF. Further, a fatigue life estimation tool based on the statistical size distribution of microstructural entities such as grains, pores and solid-state inclusions and, their mutual interaction was used to estimate the fatigue life of as-printed material. Upon deformation, CS-HEA exhibited {$\gamma$} (f.c.c.) \textrightarrow{} {$\epsilon$} (h.c.p.) martensitic transformation and subsequent twinning in {$\epsilon$} (h.c.p.) phase. Such deformation behavior resulted in sustained WH and is specifically beneficial in the vicinity of critical pores. A high normalized fatigue strength of 0.65 with respect to the yield strength was thus obtained in as-printed condition. Further, the model accurately predicted extended crack initiation life for CS-HEA. The current work therefore provides guidance towards developing defect-tolerant alloys for L-PBF and presents a tool for estimation of fatigue life of AM alloys with unconventional WH behavior.},

  abstract = {The high Fe-containing AlSi12 alloy was processed by additive manufacturing of laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) to understand the features of microstructures and mechanical properties under as-fabricated condition. The Fe impurity was found to be beneficial for mechanical property enhancement in the LPBFed samples. The parameters including the combination of laser power of 200 W, scanning speed of 1110 mm/s, hatch spacing of 0.15 mm, layer thickness of 0.03 mm and laser volumetric energy density of 40 J/mm3 were optimized to achieve a high relative density of 99.7\%. The as-LPBFed AlSi12FeMn alloy was featured by a high density of significantly refined spherical {$\alpha$}-Al(Fe,Mn)Si phase (10-50 nm), which was coherent with the Al matrix. Meanwhile, the as-LPBFed AlSi12FeMn alloy can deliver superior mechanical properties including the yield strength of 305 MPa, the ultimate tensile strength of 485 MPa and the fracture strain of 6.1\%. The improved mechanical properties are attributed to synergistic strengthening mechanisms, including solid solution strengthening, grain boundary strengthening and precipitation strengthening. Moreover, the formation of high-density stacking faults (SFs) and Lomer-Cottrell locks (LCs) in localized regions can also offer strengthening in the as-LPBFed AlSi12FeMn alloy.},

This study aims to provide basis for material constitutive parameters of widely used aluminum alloy AlSi10Mg alloy. Initially, tensile samples of AlSi10Mg alloy samples were manufactured by using SLM technology. Afterwards, through quasi-static and high temperature tensile tests, an attempt has been made to determine the Johnson-Cook material model of AlSi10Mg. in order to conduct quasi-static tensile tests, strain rates of 10-3 s-1, 10-2 s-1 and 5x10-2 s-1 were considered and tests were conducted at ambient temperature. Whereas, for high temperature tensile tests 24, 150, 300 \textdegree C temperature values were considered at the reference strain rate value of 10-3 s-1. The numerically simulated tensile results achieved by using the established Johnson-Cook model were then compared with experimental results. It was observed that the maximum error between the test and simulation results was around of 7.5\%. The error percentage is well within the acceptable, thus proving the accuracy of the established material model.},

A key feature of this approach is the fact that, unlike other commonly used numerical approaches such as finite difference methods, it is mesh-free. As such, it does not suffer (as much as other numerical methods) from the curse of dimensionality associated with highdimensional PDEs and PDE systems. The main goals of this paper are to elucidate the features, capabilities and limitations of DGM by analyzing aspects of its implementation for a number of different PDEs and PDE systems. Additionally, we present: (1) a brief overview of PDEs in quantitative finance along with numerical methods for solving them; (2) a brief overview of deep learning and, in particular, the notion of neural networks; (3) a discussion of the theoretical foundations of DGM with a focus on the justification of why this method is expected to perform well.},

During SLM, complex physical mechanisms and phenomena are taking place, affecting the overall process, thus, extensive relevant research is conducted in the recent years. Along with the experimental research that is carried out, different modeling methodologies have been proposed to simulate the process and to gain a better understanding, exploiting the capability to predict and optimize the process' results. The current paper presents a modeling methodology to simulate the formation of the melting pool during a single track in SLM, for conduction, transition and keyhole modes depending on the utilized Volumetric Energy Density (VED). A heat transfer model has been combined with deformed geometry to simulate the material vaporization, depending on the VED, since the material vaporization mechanism can be considered as a major importance parameter in the keyhole formation. To retain the generality and the simplicity of the model, only one coefficient that needs an estimation was adopted, namely, the atom recombination factor {$\beta$}R, which is directly correlated with the VED, while other parameters were defined based on analytical solutions and basic physics models. The accuracy of the model was validated through a ``blind'' comparison with experimental results from literature in terms of melting pool depth and Heat Affected Zone (HAZ) depth and width, with the simulation result being in high agreement with experimental ones. Finally, conclusion regarding the material vaporization rate and the evolution of the process in a more microscopic level were also deduced.},

The influence of heterostructures, i.e. cellular/dendritic regions with micro-segregations, formed during LPBF processing on the microstructure evolution, particularly the formation of nano-precipitates were investigated. We applied aging and solution- aging post heat-treatments to allow the precipitation in presence and after elimination of the heterostructures, respectively. A model describing the precipitation mechanisms and sequence for both heat-treatment routes is proposed based on the three-dimensional elemental distribution at near-atomic scale and the quantification of nano-scale segregated regions performed by atom probe tomography (APT). We observed that the heterostructures favored the austenite retention in the as-built condition, while they promoted the martensite-to-austenite reversion in the aged condition. On the contrary, the retention and reversion processes are suppressed in the solution-aged condition. The formation of nanosized (Ni,Fe,Co)3(Ti,Mo,Al) and (Fe,Ni,Co)7(Mo)6 precipitates was confirmed for both post heat-treatment routes. However, the nano-precipitates were smaller in size and higher in number density in the solution-aged condition, as compared to the aged state. The current work demonstrates that the elimination of heterostructures in the solution-aged condition, especially Ni micro-segregations, led to a high supersaturation and a concomitant increase in number density of (Ni,Fe,Co)3(Ti,Mo,Al) precipitates. The corresponding Ni-depleted matrix inhibited the martensite-to-austenite reversion. In contrast, the partial retention of heterostructures and the presence of retained austenite during aging without prior solution treatment resulted in a reduced number density of (Ni,Fe,Co)3(Ti,Mo,Al) precipitates, which can potentially trigger the reversion transformation supported by the rejection of Ni in front of (Fe,Ni,Co)7(Mo)6 precipitates.},

Understanding the dendrite formation processes is important because the microstructural features directly influence mechanical properties of the produced parts. An improved understanding of dendrite formation may inform design protocols to achieve optimized process parameters for controlled microstructures and enhanced properties of materials. To this end, this work implements a phase-field model to simulate directional solidification of binary alloys. For applications involving strong nonequilibrium effects, a modified antitrapping current model is incorporated to help eject solute into the liquid phase based on an experimentally calibrated, velocitydependent partitioning coefficient. Investigated allow systems include SCN, Si-As, and Ni-Nb. The SCN alloy is chosen to verify the computational method, and the other two are selected for a parametric study due to their different diffusion properties. The modified antitrapping current model is compared with the classical model in terms of predicted dendrite profiles, tip undercooling, and tip velocity. Solidification parameters\textemdash the cooling rate and the strength of anisotropy\textemdash are studied to reveal their influences on dendrite growth. Computational results demonstrate the effectiveness of the PFM and the modified antitrapping current model in simulating rapid solidification with strong nonequilibrium at the interface.},

  abstract = {Laser Powder Bed Fusion (L-PBF) is a Metal Additive Manufacturing (MAM) technology where a complex 3D metal part is built from powder layers, which are selectively consolidated using a laser heat source. The processing zone is in the order of a few tenths of micrometer, making L-PBF a multi-scale manufacturing process. The formation and growth of gas pores and the creation of un-melted powder zones can be predicted by multiphysics models. Also, with these models, the melt pool shape and size, temperature distribution, melt pool fluid flow and its microstructural features like grain size and morphology can be calculated. In this work, a high fidelity multi-physics meso-scale numerical model is developed for stainless steel 316-L which includes melting, solidification, fluid flow, surface tension, thermo-capillarity, evaporation and multiple reflection with ray-tracing. A statistical study using a full Design of Experiments (DoE) method was conducted, wherein the impact of uncertain material properties and process parameters namely absorptivity, recoil pressure (vaporization) and laser beam size on the melt pool shape and size was analysed. Furthermore, to emphasize on the significance of the above mentioned uncertain input parameters on the melt pool dynamics, a main effects plot was created which showed that absorptivity had the highest impact followed by laser beam size. The significance of recoil pressure on the melt pool size increases with melt pool volume which is dependent on absorptivity. The prediction accuracy of the model is validated by comparing the melt pool shape and size from the simulation with single track experiments that were produced with similar process parameters. Moreover, the effect of thermal lensing was considered in the numerical model by increasing the laser beam size and later on the resultant melt pool profile was compared with experiments to show the robustness of the model.},

Process parameters, such as laser power, scanning strategy or inert gas properties, affect the generation of emissions and by-products such as spatters and fumes and their removal from the process chamber. Numerous authors investigated these effects in numerical studies to predict suitable process parameter sets. However, the basic challenge of modelling time-dependent particle and heat ejection from the moving melt pool region as well as predicting of the resulting transport and deposition mechanisms with sufficient accuracy still remains. In this context, an approach of modelling the statistical particle ejection as well as underlying heat transfer into the process chamber through analytical considerations is presented. Particle transport and deposition are numerically investigated for the case of a real case of application. Several production layers are covered in one transient simulation, assessing the influence of different scanning strategies. Especially the effect of convective flow caused by high heat influx through the melt pool is investigated. Results are compared to data obtained from an associated experiment. The presented model enables numerical simulation of arbitrary scanning patterns and laser properties without the need for preceding experimental studies determining pattern specific ejection rates.},

Although process parameters are considered important in the fabrication of functional parts, the effect of atmospheric gas has not been comprehensively documented. In laser powder bed fusion (LPBF), gas flow is used to eliminate fumes generated by laser irradiation. Simultaneously, the gas removes heat from the laser-irradiated part, which is exposed to high temperature. In this study, we investigated the capacity of helium as an alternative to argon, which is conventionally used as the LPBF atmosphere gas. He has a higher thermal conductivity and lower gas density than Ar, which may result in enhanced heat removal from the Ti-6Al-4V alloy during fabrication. Numerical simulations suggest a greater cooling rate under He flow. Further, the material built under He flow contained finer {$\alpha$}'-martensite grains and showed improved mechanical properties compared to those fabricated under Ar flow, despite the identical laser irradiation conditions. Thus, He gas is advantageous in LPBF for fabricating products with superior mechanical performance through microstructural refinement, and this is a result of its capacity for cooling and fume generation inhibition. Therefore, this study reveals the importance of the choice of atmospheric gas because of its effects on the characteristics of metallic specimens fabricated using LPBF.},

  abstract = {The present work proposes a data-driven method to address the issue of increased computational time in predicting the thermal field in the Powder Bed Fusion process (PBF). Understanding the temperature field evolution is essential in metal Additive Manufacturing (AM) process like PBF technology to produce the right quality parts. As the process of metal AM involves physical phenomena, including fluid flow, heat and mass transfer, as well as structural loads, the underlying physics is complex and difficult to predict temperature fields in reasonable time with increased accuracy. Physical experiments and numerical simulations can be expensive and time-consuming. Hence a data-driven approach has been introduced to address the issue of increased computational time to predict the thermal field developed during the process. The methodology proposed in this work consists of a thermal model and a surrogate model based on Gaussian Process Regression (GPR). Initially, the transient thermal behaviour is studied based on Finite Element Analysis (FEA). Later, a surrogate model based on the Gaussian process is developed from the FE simulated data to decrease the computational costs of high-fidelity physics-based simulations. The GPR model has predicted the thermal fields in less time than that of the physics-based FEA model. To validate our approach, both the numerical simulations and GPR-based model are justified by conducting single-track experimentations using Inconel 625 (IN625). The results have shown that the proposed GPR model predictions are in good agreement with the temperature measured from experiments. The studies have revealed the influence of process parameters like scan speed and laser power on the thermal field. Single track dimension for laser exposure seem to correlate with GPR predicted track width. This prediction could be employed to predict distortion, residual stress and other process response in a shorter time.},

Differently from previous works on ALE, which generally adopt conservative variables (i.e. mass and momentum) and rely on the use of Riemann solvers inside the spatial operators, the proposed model is expressed in terms of primitive variables (i.e. density and velocity) and is written by using the standard differential formulations of the weakly-compressible SPH schemes. Similarly to ALE-SPH models, the arbitrary velocity field is obtained by modifying the pure Lagrangian velocity of the material point through a velocity {$\delta$}u\textrightarrow{} given by a Particle Shifting Technique (PST). We show that the above-mentioned ALE-SPH equations are, however, unstable when they are integrated in time. The instability appears in the form of large volume variations in those fluid regions characterised by high velocity strain rates. Nonetheless, the scheme can be stabilised if appropriate diffusion terms are included in both the equations of density and mass. This latter scheme, hereinafter called {$\delta$}-ALE-SPH scheme, is validated against reference benchmark test-cases: the viscous flow around an inclined elliptical cylinder, the lid-driven cavity and a dam-break flow impacting a vertical wall.},

Upon deformation, mechanical twinning occurs. Early plastic instabilities arise due to the fine substructure with high defect density, resulting in profuse shear banding. Such shear bands carry most of the subsequent deformation, reducing the volume fraction of oxide particles along these regions due to enhanced particle dissolution via cracking/fragmentation. Upon annealing, the cold-rolled specimens show abnormal {$<$}110{$>$} || ND grains nucleating at shear bands. The earlier recrystallization onset and fragmented particle dissolution in shear bands result in a local lower Zener pinning and generate a size advantage for {$<$}110{$>$} || ND grains. Based on this investigation, abnormal growth may be triggered by shear bands in cold-rolled and annealed LPBF alloys for grain boundary engineering. Our results suggest that avoiding shear banding (and the consequent particle fragmentation) inhibits abnormal grain growth, thus yielding a more uniform and fine-grained microstructure.},

  abstract = {Alloys manufactured by laser powder-bed fusion have intrinsic and hierarchical microstructural features inherited from fast solidification (up to 104 K/s) and subsequent thermal cycles. This creates epitaxial grains, dislocation cell structures, and second-phase oxide nanoparticles. Epitaxial grains follow a pattern where finer grains are found in the melt pool centerline along the laser track. Upon further annealing, this characteristic microstructure has pronounced consequences on the recrystallization mechanisms and thus on grain topology. By changing the scanning strategy, we control the emerging grain patterns in a representative alloy (AISI 316L austenitic stainless steel) by creating linear strings for unidirectional scans, while a chessboard grain pattern arises by applying a 90\textdegree -rotation between layers. Upon post-processing annealing (at 1150\textdegree C from 15 min to 8 h), we study the relationship between the as-built and recrystallized microstructures. Recrystallization starts with fine nuclei in regions with high dislocation density along the melt pool centerlines, resulting in early-stage linear impingement (linearly clustered nucleation), as revealed by microstructural path analysis. Recrystallization is sluggish, due to dynamic Zener-Smith pinning. This effect leads to jerky boundary motion due to periodic pinning and release from oxide particles, caused by their gradual coarsening. Lower nuclei number density slows kinetics for the case of unidirectional scanning, while twinning aids in the nucleation of grains with mobile grain boundaries. Our findings show that changes in the laser scanning strategy are a suitable design tool for tailoring recrystallization and thus microstructure.},

  abstract = {The ultimate goal for structural materials is achieving both high strength and ductility. However, increasing one of these properties can usually decrease the other, resulting in the so-called strength-ductility trade-off. According to the Consid\`ere criterion, increased strain hardening rates are demanded at higher strains to prevent necking and strain localization. This study reports a novel approach based on strain hardening engineering in a laser powder-bed fusion (LPBF) 304L stainless steel deformed by tensile testing. The nucleation of {$\alpha$}'-martensite directly from austenite ({$\gamma$}) was observed without the formation of the intermediate {$\epsilon$}-phase. Both fine (11\,{$\mu$}m) and coarse (93\,{$\mu$}m) grains initially undergo dislocation slip and stacking fault formation in the as-built cellular structure up to a logarithmic strain ({$\epsilon$}) of 0.05. Fine austenite grains exhibit {$\alpha$}'-martensite growing along the extended stacking fault bands ({$\epsilon$}\,{$>$}\,0.05), while coarse {$\langle<$}110{$\rangle>$} || LD (loading direction) oriented {$\gamma$}-grains primarily accommodate the imposed macroscopic strain via twinning (0.2\,{$>$}\,{$\epsilon$}\,{$>$}\,0.05), followed by martensitic transformation or activation of other twinning systems ({$\epsilon$}\,{$>$}\,0.2). Deformation twinning is hindered within fine grains due to a (1) higher twinning activation stress and (2) an unfavorable crystallographic orientation. The hierarchical deformation reported for 304L stainless steel is crucial for component and alloy-for-LPBF design. This study reveals the possibility of using LPBF for strain hardening engineering through grain size control, triggering the hierarchical deformation (and their interaction) in each grain family. As a result, high-strength and ductile alloys may be obtained by exploring this novel processing approach.},

  abstract = {Microscopic defects may occur during powder-bed fusion processes which originate from molten pool instabilities. To investigate this issue, a numerical model focusing on the interaction between laser and powder, melt pool formation and thermodynamics effects is on development. The approach used in the model assumes an incompressible Newtonian flow based on an enthalpy-porosity method for solid/liquid metal transition. The jump conditions at the liquid-solid interface for the energy equation are included through the modification of the enthalpy which incorporates the latent heat of fusion. A Carman-Kozeny porosity method is implemented in the momentum equation to penalize the flow in the solid phase. Molten flows are driven by natural and thermocapillary convection which are modelled using Boussinesq approximation and Marangoni free-surface stresses respectively. This numerical model is implemented within a Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) finite element formulation which ensures high order convergence on unstructured mesh [1].  In this work, a sharp interface method is integrated into the three dimensional high-order DG code Argo [2] to capture the free surface of the melt pool. This method allows to keep the high-order of convergence of the DG scheme even near the interface not conforming with the mesh. This is essential to capture the thermo-hydrodynamics phenomena during powder-bed fusion with accuracy.  Current effort is dedicated to improve the model accounting for physical phenomena such as surface tension and vaporization. The main purpose is to investigate the occurrence of discontinuities in fused powder tracks depending on material properties and process parameters.},

To this end, high magnification advanced microstructural characterization in connection with the tensile flow and strain hardening (i.e., work hardening) behavior of the materials were studied. Ambient temperature uniaxial tensile tests, based on ASTM E8/E8M, were conducted on the LPBF and cast as well as post-heat treated (T7: overaged and stabilized) materials were performed systematically. Results show a pronounced discontinuous yielding for the LPBF material along with extended ductility. The tensile curve of the LPBF T7 heat-treated material showed some plastic instabilities (Portevin\textendash Le Chatelier effect) in the inelastic region. However, none of these phenomena were observed in the cast material, while ductility is limited. These responses were attributed to the very high cooling/solidification rates experienced by the LPBF materials, which result in a very fine equiaxed and supersaturated aluminum grain structure as compared with the coarse-grained structure of the cast counter material.},

While microstructural characterization is widely spread and well known, the microstructural classification is mostly done manually by human experts, which gives rise to uncertainties due to subjectivity. Since the microstructure could be a combination of different phases or constituents with complex substructures its automatic classification is very challenging and only a few prior studies exist. Prior works focused on designed and engineered features by experts and classified microstructures separately from the feature extraction step. Recently, Deep Learning methods have shown strong performance in vision applications by learning the features from data together with the classification step. In this work, we propose a Deep Learning method for microstructural classification in the examples of certain microstructural constituents of low carbon steel. This novel method employs pixel-wise segmentation via Fully Convolutional Neural Network (FCNN) accompanied by a max-voting scheme. Our system achieves 93.94\% classification accuracy, drastically outperforming the state-of-the-art method of 48.89\% accuracy. Beyond the strong performance of our method, this line of research offers a more robust and first of all objective way for the difficult task of steel quality appreciation.},

We describe a procedure in which the experimental measurements are used to perform characterisation and reveal the associated uncertainties. Moreover, we explore performance of this characterisation procedure and propose a robust defect characterisation approach. The performance of the proposed approach is studied experimentally, and the sizing errors are small (within 0.09 or 0.23mm for fatigue cracks at 2.5 MHz, and within 0.38 or 0.24mm for volumetric defects in an additive manufactured specimen at 10 MHz).

  abstract = {In this work an adaptive Finite Element strategy to deal with the numerical simulation of Additive Manufacturing processes is presented. The Selective Laser Melting (SLM) is chosen as the reference technology because of its great diffusion in the industrial manufacturing chain. An octree-based mesh adaptivity approach is adopted allowing for the use of much finer meshes within the processing zone, the so called Thermo-Mechanically Affected Zone (TMAZ), if compared to the rest of the computational domain. Although the adaptive meshing is vital to keep controlled the computational resources through the entire simulation of the fabrication process, the accuracy of the results can be compromised by the coarsening strategy, and particularly when simulating the SLM process, where the mesh size can vary from microns (TMAZ) to centimetres (close to the build-plate). This loss of accuracy can spoil the original efforts in refining the mesh in the process zone. Therefore a strategy to compensate for information loss in the adaptive refinement simulation of additive manufacturing processes is developed. The main idea is to add two correction terms which exactly compensate for the loss of accuracy in the coarsening process of the mesh in the already manufactured regions. The proposed correction terms can be interpreted as a Variational Multiscale enhancement on the adaptive mesh. This allows one to successfully simulate the additive manufacturing process by using an adaptively coarsened mesh, with results which have an accuracy equivalent to the one of a uniformly refined mesh simulation, at a fraction of the computational cost. Numerical examples illustrate the performance of the proposed strategy.},

The different matrix microstructure components and phases (austenite, ferrite, martensite) and the various precipitation phases (intermetallic precipitates, carbides) lend a huge variability in microstructure and properties to this class of alloys. This is true for AM-produced steels just as it is for conventionally-produced steels. However, steels are subjected during AM processing to time-temperature profiles which are very different from the ones encountered in conventional process routes, and hence the resulting microstructures differ strongly as well. This includes a very fine and highly morphologically and crystallographically textured microstructure as a result of high solidification rates as well as non-equilibrium phases in the as-processed state. Such a microstructure, in turn, necessitates additional or adapted post-AM heat treatments and alloy design adjustments. In this review, we give an overview over the different kinds of steels in use in fusion-based AM processes and present their microstructures, their mechanical and corrosion properties, their heat treatments and their intended applications. This includes austenitic, duplex, martensitic and precipitation-hardening stainless steels, TRIP/TWIP steels, maraging and carbon-bearing tool steels and ODS steels. We identify areas with missing information in the literature and assess which properties of AM steels exceed those of conventionally-produced ones, or, conversely, which properties fall behind. We close our review with a short summary of iron-base alloys with functional properties and their application perspectives in Additive Manufacturing.},

  abstract = {Additive manufacturing processes have been investigated and some of them developed commercially since the late 1980s. With Selective Laser Melting (SLM), components can be produced by localized melting of successive layers of metal powder. In comparison with today's conventional techniques, this way of manufacturing allows for considerably more freedom in designing and has a tremendous economic potential. Thus, it is particularly interesting for the production of geometrically complex aero engine components. By local melting with a laser beam such engine components have already been manufactured from the heat-resistant nickel alloy Inconel 718. To ensure the quality, the starting powder and the manufacturing parameters are supervised; also, the built-up components are inspected nondestructively. In order to be able to describe and to understand the complex dynamics of the SLM processes more accurately, online ultrasonic measurements have been performed for the first time. In this contribution, we report on the integration of the measurement technique into the manufacturing facility. We present first results based on generalized B-scans which illustrate the build-up of test specimens based on single layers of 40 \textmu m thickness. The analysis of the ultrasonic signals allows to infer information about the fusion of the single layers and about the temporal formation of material defects. We also discuss the further potential of ultrasonic measurements.},

In this paper, we propose an automated quality grading system for the AM process using a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) model. The CNN model is trained offline using the images of the internal and surface defects in the layer-by-layer deposition of materials and tested online by studying the performance of detecting and classifying the failure in AM process at different extruder speeds and temperatures. The model demonstrates the accuracy of 94\% and specificity of 96\%, as well as above 75\% in three classifier measures of the Fscore, the sensitivity, and precision for classifying the quality of the printing process in five grades in real-time. The proposed online model adds an automated, consistent, and non-contact quality control signal to the AM process that eliminates the manual inspection of parts after they are entirely built. The quality monitoring signal can also be used by the machine to suggest remedial actions by adjusting the parameters in real-time. The proposed quality predictive model serves as a proof-of-concept for any type of AM machines to produce reliable parts with fewer quality hiccups while limiting the waste of both time and materials.},

This is particularly true in the world of alloy design, where new metallic materials have historically been developed through tedious processes and procedures based primarily on casting methodologies. With the onset of directed energy deposition (DED) and powder bed fusion (PBF)-based AM, new alloys can be innovated and evaluated rapidly at a lower cost and considerably shorter lead time than has ever been achieved. This article details the advantages, challenges, applications, and perspectives of alloy design using primarily laser-based AM.

We used two different alloys to study hot cracking in Hastelloy-X: one with 0.12 mass\% yttrium added and one with no yttrium. Y-free Hastelloy-X exhibited less cracks, mainly due to the segregation of Si, W, and C resulting in SiC- and W6C-type carbides at the grain boundary and interdendritic regions. On the other hand, more cracks formed in the Y-added Hastelloy-X specimen because of segregation of Y, resulting in the formation of yttrium-rich carbide (YC). Post-heat treatment was conducted at 1177 \textdegree C for 2 h, followed by air cooling, to obtain good creep properties. We carried out a creep test along the vertical and horizontal directions. Despite having more cracks, the Y-added as-built Hastelloy-X specimen showed longer creep life and ductility than the Hastelloy-X specimen. This was mainly because of the formation of Y2O3 and SiO2 inside the grains. After solution treatment, the Y-added specimen's creep life was eight times longer than that of the Y-free solution-treated specimen. This was mainly because of the maintenance of the columnar grain morphology even after solution treatment. In addition, the formation of M6C carbides, Y2O3, and SiO2 improved creep life. To summarize the effect of Y, Y addition promoted the formation of cracks, which brought about creep anisotropy; however, it improved creep properties through the stabilization of oxygen and the promotion of discrete carbide precipitation, which prohibited the migration and sliding of grain boundary.},

In this work, preliminary studies on designing and tailoring a low-alloyed steel for the laser-based powder bed fusion (PBF-LB/M) process by adding carbon black (C) nanoparticles and tungsten carbide (WC) particles for enhancing the material properties are provided. First, the base material 16MnCr5 is modified with different concentrations of C and WC. It was found that an increased C and WC content resulted in an elevated material hardness in the as-built state. However, this comes at the cost of a poorer processability as pore formation increased for C-modified and crack tendency increased for WC-modified 16MnCr5. When applying a post-process quenching and optional tempering heat treatment, material hardness in the range of 615~HV can be achieved for C-enriched 16MnCr5 in the tempered state, which would be suitable for bearing and gearing applications. The addition of WC particles favored an improved wear resistance which is twice as high as the one of C-modified material for similar material hardness, showing the enormous potential of WC addition for reducing the wear rate. Complementary SEM and EDX analyses show that both the dilution and bonding zone of the WC particles are affected by the processing conditions and the WC concentration. Furthermore, it was found that a nearly defect-free fabrication of WC-enriched 16MnCr5 was possible for up to 2.5~wt.-\% of WC, proving that the occurring defects are highly sensitive to the WC concentration.},

Among other factors, surface tension influences the robustness of this process. Three aluminum alloys were investigated by means of 3D laser printing with respect to their ability to form lightweight and high-performance structures. The alloys include two Al-Cr based alloys (Zicromal\`O: AlCr-Zr-Mn, Scancromal\`O: Al-Cr-Sc-Zr) and an Al-Mg based alloy (Scalmalloy\`O: Al-Mg-Sc-Mn-Zr). The surface tensions of their liquid melts were measured by means of the oscillating droplet method in electromagnetic levitation. Scalmalloy\`O exhibited a surface tension that was by 3-8\% smaller than the other two alloys, over a temperature range of 500 K above their liquidus temperature; the evaporation analysis showed that Scancromal\`O exhibits significantly less evaporation compared to the other two alloys by an order of magnitude. During the Laser Powder Bed Fusion process, Scalmalloy\`O presented the most unstable melt dynamics, and Scancromal\`O appeared to be more robust and stable with less weld spatters and negligible dust deposition, as evidence from the high-speed video observations. The results support the idea that surface tension and evaporation are potentially crucial factors influencing the melt dynamics and also demonstrate the capability of additive manufacturing that produces customized aluminum alloys for aerospace applications.},

Several microfluidic components, including traps, channels, filters and pumps, for manipulating aqueous droplets suspended in a film of oil on blank, unpatterned substrates are demonstrated. These are `virtual' devices because they have no physical structure; they accomplish their function entirely by localized variations in surface tension (Marangoni flows) created in a non-contact manner by heat sources suspended just above the liquid surface. Various flow patterns can be engineered through the geometric design of the heat sources on size scales ranging from 10 to 1000 \textmu m. A point source generates toroidal flows which can be used for droplet merging and mixing. Virtual channels and traps, emulated by linear and annular heat fluxes, respectively, demonstrate nearly 100\% size selectivity for droplets ranging from 300 to 1000 \textmu m. A source of heat flux that is parallel to the surface and is triangular with a 10\textdegree{} taper serves as a linear pump, translating droplets of about the same size at speeds up to 200 \textmu m s-1. The paper includes simulations that illuminate the working principle of the devices. Models show that Marangoni flows scale favorably to small length scales. By using microscale thermal devices delivering sharp temperature gradients, it is possible to generate mm s-1 flow velocities with only small increases ({$<$}1\textdegree ) in liquid temperature.},

Here, we present a path to achieve this goal in direct laser writing, an additive manufacturing method based on photopolymerization that commonly suffers from strong shrinkage-induced effects. First, we introduce a method for measuring the shrinkage of distinct direct laser written lines. We then introduce a semi-empirical numerical model to capture the interplay of sequentially polymerized material and the resulting macroscopic effects. Finally, we implement an artificial neural network to evaluate given laser trajectories in terms of the resulting part quality. The presented approach proves feasibility of using artificial neural networks to assess the quality of 3D printing trajectories and thereby demonstrates a potential route for reducing the impact of material shrinkage on 3D printed parts.}

The formation of grain structure in 316~L stainless steel fusion lines is investigated in this paper, combining experimental results and numerical simulations. Experimentally, fusion lines are built on a 316~L substrate, using an instrumented LPBF process. The high-speed camera recordings combined with the characterization of the samples enables capturing of melt-pool sizes and grain characteristics. The numerical modelling is based on a three-dimensional ``CAFE'' model, coupling Cellular Automata and Finite Element models to predict grain formation. The thermal model is defined and calibrated using the experiments. The experimental and numerical grain characteristics are compared. Numerical results are discussed with regards to the growth models and the process parameters. The growth model defined here is compared to existing models and is well fitted to capture grain formation in single-track configurations. Finally, the average grain size and aspect ratio of the grains increase with an increase of the process' linear energy.},

Many parameters influence the printing process; however, defects resulting from suboptimal parameter settings are usually detected after the process. To detect these defects during the printing, different process monitoring techniques such as melt pool monitoring or off-axis infrared monitoring have been proposed. In this work, we used a combination of thermographic off-axis imaging as data source and deep learning-based neural network architectures, to detect printing defects. For the network training, a k-fold cross validation and a hold-out cross validation were used. With these techniques, defects such as delamination and splatter can be recognized with an accuracy of 96.80\%. In addition, the model was evaluated with computing class activation heatmaps. The architecture is very small and has low computing costs, which means that it is suitable to operate in real time even on less powerful hardware.},

  abstract = {Several different interfacial forces affect the free surface of liquid metals during metal additive manufacturing processes. One of these is thermo-capillarity or the so-called Marangoni effect. In this work, a novel framework is introduced for unraveling the effects of thermo-capillarity on the melt pool morphology/size and its thermo-fluid conditions during the Laser Powder Bed Fusion (L-PBF) process. In this respect, a multi-physics numerical model is developed based on the commercial software package Flow-3D. The model is verified and validated via mesh-independency analysis and by comparison of the predicted melt pool profile with those from lab-scale single-track experiments. Two sets of parametric studies are carried out to find the role of both positive and inverse thermo-capillarity on the melt pool shape and its thermal and fluid dynamics conditions. The thermo-fluid conditions of the melt pool are further investigated using appropriate dimensionless numbers. The results show that for the higher Marangoni number cases, the melt pool temperature drops, and at the same time, the temperature field becomes more uniform. Also, it is shown that at higher Marangoni numbers, temperature gradients decrease, thus reducing the role of conduction in the heat transfer from the melt pool. Furthermore, for the first time, a novel methodology is introduced for the calculation of the melt pool's average Nusselt number. The average Nusselt numbers calculated for the positive and inverse thermo-capillarity are then used for finding the effective liquid conductivity required for a computationally cheaper pure heat conduction simulation. The results show that the deviation between the average melt pool temperature, using the pure conduction model with effective conductivity, and the one obtained from the advanced fluid dynamics model is less than 2\%.},

  abstract = {Numerical simulations have recently shown their potential as a robust, cheap and reliable tool for predicting the quality of components produced by metal additive manufacturing (MAM) processes. Despite the advantages of the MAM processes over conventional manufacturing methods, there is still a lack of thorough understanding on how different defects can form and originate during MAM processing. In that respect, advanced numerical techniques recently developed have the ability to predict the occurrence of such defects. These techniques have paved the way to efficiently obtain the optimal processing window for targeted mechanical properties to satisfy the end-use design requirements. The aim of this review paper is hence to present and classify numerical simulations of MAM, not solely based on their length-scale as often seen, but also based on the involved physics, as well as the modelling strategies at both the meso-scale and part-scale. The paper is arranged in the following way: First, literature describing purely conduction-based heat transfer simulations at meso-scale are presented. This is followed by a review of fluid-based simulations of increasing complexity based on the treatment of free surface of the melt pool at meso-scale. Finally, contributions based on different part-scale modeling approaches with a focus on thermo-mechanical behavior are reviewed.},

Automatic differentiation (AD), also called algorithmic differentiation or simply "autodiff", is a family of techniques similar to but more general than backpropagation for efficiently and accurately evaluating derivatives of numeric functions expressed as computer programs. AD is a small but established field with applications in areas including computational fluid dynamics, atmospheric sciences, and engineering design optimization. Until very recently, the fields of machine learning and AD have largely been unaware of each other and, in some cases, have independently discovered each other's results. Despite its relevance, general-purpose AD has been missing from the machine learning toolbox, a situation slowly changing with its ongoing adoption under the names "dynamic computational graphs" and "differentiable programming". We survey the intersection of AD and machine learning, cover applications where AD has direct relevance, and address the main implementation techniques. By precisely defining the main differentiation techniques and their interrelationships, we aim to bring clarity to the usage of the terms "autodiff", "automatic differentiation", and "symbolic differentiation" as these are encountered more and more in machine learning settings.},

As the industry has high demands on the quality of these printed parts, a proper process monitoring is needed to ensure reliable parts while reducing costs. This approach focuses on the Powder Bed Fusion technology and adds an additional laser microphone to monitor the print process in-situ. Multiple defects can occur while printing, one of these is porosity. Since porosity has a strong influence on part stability, there must be no deviations here. To detect the level of porosity early on, a 2D Convolutional Neural Network was trained on in-situ audio recordings. Within an easy to use tweakable pipeline mel spectrograms were generated and fed into the neural network for classification of the porosity level. A F1-Score of 98,5\% proves the concept that porosity defects of printed parts can indeed be effectively detected within production by neural networks fed with audio spectrograms. Porosity can thus be directly derived during the printing process itself, saving costs and material as a porous print can be stopped early and a x-ray after the print is done is not necessary anymore. This approach proves that integrated sensors in the printing process can deliver a huge benefit to the additive manufacturing in production.},

In this methodology, a high-fidelity fluid mechanics based model of additive manufacturing is employed as the first step in a simulation workflow. This fluid model uses a level set field to track the location of the boundary between the solid material and background gas and precisely predicts temperatures and material deposition shapes from additive manufacturing process parameters. The resulting deposition shape and temperature field from the fluid model are then mapped into a solid mechanics formulation to provide a more accurate surface topology for radiation and convection boundary conditions and a prescribed temperature field. Solid mechanics simulations are then conducted to predict the evolution of material stresses and microstructure within a part. By combining thermal history and deposition shape from fluid mechanics with residual stress and material property evolutions from solid mechanics, additional fidelity and precision are incorporated into additive manufacturing process simulations providing new insight into complex DED builds.},

Indeed, most of the standard Al alloys are susceptible to solidification cracking and can hardly be used to produce structural parts by laser-based additive manufacturing processes. In this study, we investigate the strategies to design high-strength Al alloys for Laser Powder Bed Fusion. The addition of Zr to the chemical composition of an Al\textendash Mg\textendash Si alloy (EN AW 6182) was carried out by following two different routes to promote the formation of equiaxed grains which are able to suppress hot cracking and enhance processability of the material. The first route is based on mechanical mixing of ZrH2 particles and gas-atomized Al alloy powder and on the in-situ reaction of the hydride to form Al3Zr nucleants. The second route relies on the use of pre-alloyed gas-atomized powders that feature Zr among the alloy elements. The specimens produced using pre-alloyed powder showed the best mechanical performance. After direct aging from the as-built condition, the alloy showed yield strength and ultimate tensile strength of 354 and 363~MPa, respectively, and elongation at fracture of 9.0~pct. The achieved properties are comparable to those of wrought 6182 alloy processed by conventional routes.},

Samples produced with optimised parameters featured relative density of 99.91\%, with no solidification cracks within their microstructure.

This constraint limits the diffusion of this technology in many industrial fields, including aerospace and motorsport sectors. In this study, a novel high-strength aluminium alloy for Laser Powder Bed Fusion was designed and its solidification behaviour, microstructure and mechanical performance were investigated. The results were compared with those achieved by processing the high-strength A20X alloy processed with the same technology. The alloy was designed based on the chemical composition of the widely used 2618 Al alloy, a conventional high strength Al-Cu-Mg alloy for high temperature applications. The chemical composition of the 2618 alloy was modified by adding Ti and B, which form TiB2 particles that act as nuclei for the solidification of primary {$\alpha$}-Al grains. The resulting microstructure made of equiaxed grains revealed resistant to hot cracking. A20X and 2618-modified alloys produced with optimized parameters featured relative densities higher than 99,7\% and crack-free microstructures. The A20X-T6 showed yield strength and ultimate tensile strength of 428 MPa and 485 MPa, respectively, while the modified 2618-T6 revealed upper yield strength and ultimate tensile strength of 370 MPa and 468 MPa, respectively. The two alloys also showed a remarkably high strength at 150\textdegree C and 250\textdegree C, exceeding the typical strength values of the 2618 alloy produced by forging.},

Component optimization possibilities and performance potential expand enormously when this becomes possible. However, the extreme conditions created by AM energy sources and the nature of alloy solidification under such conditions are not adequately understood. Modeling and simulation tools capable of quantitatively predicting AM microstructural outputs would enable a major leap forward. We demonstrate through experimental validation that a multiscale (nm/ns to mm/ms) simulation framework coupling CALPHAD thermodynamic models, microstructure scale phase field simulations, and laser track scale multiphysics simulations can quantitatively predict tailored microstructure formation in laser processed Ti-Nb. Extensive simulations and analysis of detailed microstructural predictions over a broad range of conditions reveal scaling laws for characteristic microstructural features that should generalize to a wide range of materials. Several of our findings highlight the central importance of the alloy freezing range {$\Delta$}Tf, which provides the basis of a generalized strategy for optimizing spatial control of microstructure during AM. This proposed strategy integrates alloy design with process design \& control to identify optimal material and process condition combinations. We have also identified conditions and phenomena that appear to require a more complete treatment of far from equilibrium solidification kinetics, highlighting a fundamental need in the field. We anticipate that further development of such methodologies will contribute centrally to realizing the potential of materials with spatially tailored microstructure.},

A manual data analysis method is given, and the events indicated by the analysis (DMP-meltpool events) are shown to correlate to the static tensile properties of the samples built. These events indicate the probability of material discontinuities (defects) in the metal additive manufacturing (AM) parts. In order to do so, cylindrical bars of Ti-6Al-4V ELI were built and monitored using DMP-meltpool. The tensile properties of the printed cylinders were correlated with the events detected by DMP-meltpool. An inverse relation between plastic elongation and the DMP-meltpool event density was observed. These results show that DMP-meltpool can be used to predict the quality of AM parts by detecting variations in the signals and tagging these events throughout the build as defects. Thus the technique can be employed for first stage in-line quality control of AM parts and for sorting out parts with potential defects non-destructively. The DMP-meltpool events could have significant correlations with other mechanical properties (like fatigue, hardness, fracture toughness, and crack propagation) since such properties are influenced by defects originating from the process instabilities.},

The combined imaging shows the formation of a stable plume over stable surface depressions, which becomes chaotic following transition to a full keyhole. We quantify process instability across several parameter sets by analysing keyhole and plume morphologies, and identify a previously unreported threshold of the energy input required for stable line scans. The effect of the powder layer and its impact on process stability is explored.

  abstract = {An analytical conduction model is implemented for the multi-track raster scanning of a heat spot over sequential neighboring tracks upon a half-space surface, focusing on maximum temperature rise as a function of subsurface position as its primary example of a thermal response of interest, with simple rectangular surface regions scanned and the non-dimensionalization of the analysis (to heat spot size and power as well as half-space thermal properties) intended to broaden applicability of model output. As baseline, first the case of isolated single passes is studied, as would also approximate cases of long times between sequential passes, with no heating from a prior pass available to affect that during a following pass. Asymptotic behavior is found describing all slow scanning speed conditions as described by low Peclet number Pe {$\leq$} 0.1, where isotherms of maximum temperature rise may be plotted as a function of position through the subsurface cross-section. Similar description for fast-scanning high Peclet conditions Pe {$\geq$} 40 is also achieved, although temperature rise and depth must both additionally be multiplied by \,Pe before attaining isotherms asymptotically pertinent for all high Pe. Such high Pe cases are those for which the effect of shorter finite times between neighboring passes is further studied here, since for any given practical stroke length the correspondingly higher scanning speed results in reduced time between passes and thus more opportunity for a heat accumulation effect. Indeed, at a fixed Pe, for a given point within the body cross-section located in proximity to a track several passes into the region being scanned, its temperature rise is greater than for a single isolated pass, and that temperature rise increases further with decreasing time between neighboring passes, as would result from a decreased period of the cyclic scanning motion. This heat accumulation effect builds for passes further into the rectangular surface region from the first track scanned at the region's edge, and stabilizes after some number of tracks in, a number found to decrease with increased track spacing. Likewise, if instead holding scanning period and in turn time between passes constant, maximum temperature rises at any given position are also found to increase with decreasing Pe, when maximum temperature rise and depth position are expressed in their modified high Peclet asymptotic forms as multiplied by Pe. The analysis further suggests that if maximum temperature rises and depths are both expressed in such modified forms, any further effect of Peclet number may instead be combined with that of non-dimensionalized scanning period as a function only of their product L* = Pe{$\tau$}*, the non-dimensional track length. Finally, while maximum temperature rise behavior around the mid-stroke location will be similar regardless of whether scanning is via back\&forth or one-way pass motions and furthermore in one-way motions these maximum temperature rises will remain fairly uniform with position along the track length as each possesses the same elapsed time since proximity during the previous adjacent pass, in back\&forth motion the time since proximity during the previous pass before turn-around and in turn maximum temperature rise will instead vary with position along the track.},

Additive manufacturing is a promising field for the advancement of manufacturing due to its ability to yield near-net-shaped components that require minimal post-processing prior to end-use. AM also allows for the fabrication of prototypes as well as economical small batch production. Aluminum alloys processed via AM would be very beneficial to the manufacturing industry due to their high strength to weight ratio; however, many of the conventional alloy compositions have been shown to be incompatible with AM processing methods. As a result, many investigations have looked to methods to improve the processability of these alloys. This paper explores the use of nanostructures to enhance the processability of aluminum alloys. It is concluded that the addition of nanostructures is a promising route for modification of existing alloys and may be beneficial to other powder-based processes.},

All methods are embedded into a unified low-Mach framework based on a Cartesian-grid finite-volume discretization. This framework includes a sharp transport of the interface, a wellbalanced surface tension discretization and a consistent mass and momentum transport which allows capillary-driven simulations with high density ratio. The comparison relies on shared metrics for geometrical accuracy, mass and momentum conservation which exposes the weakness and strengths of each method. Finally, the versatility and capabilities of the proposed solver are demonstrated on the simulation of a 3D head-on collision of two water droplets. Overall, all methods manage to retrieve reasonable results for all test cases presented. VOF, CLSVOF and ACLS tend to artificially create little structures while SLS suffers from conservation issues in the mesh resolution limit. This study leads us to the conclusion that CLSVOF is the most promising method for two-phase flow simulations in our specific framework because of its inherent conservation properties and topology accuracy.},

Mixing dissimilar powders, however, turns out a heterogeneous alloying with elements segregation and unconsolidated powder particles. Therefore, the purpose of this work is twofold. First, this paper describes how the in-situ alloying of AlSi10Mg and Cu powders affects the distribution of mixed elements within the as-built alloy. On the other hand, a post-process homogenization heat-treatment was set up to increase the alloy homogeneity. The presence of Cu inhomogeneities was verified both in single scan tracks and bulk samples. Their origin was traced back to the different thermo-physical properties of starting powders. Consequently, due to the intrinsic hardening effect of Cu, nano-hardness spikes in correspondence with Cu segregations were measured. To homogenize the alloy properties across the material bulk, a homogenization heat-treatment at 515 \textdegree C was then conducted. After heat-treating, Cu inhomogeneities and intermetallic \texttheta - Al2Cu phase were dissolved entirely into Al matrix leading to an effective alloy homogenization.},

To get superior strength, 4~wt\% of Cu was added to AlSi10Mg composition to benefit from the additional solid solution and precipitation strengthening mechanisms induced by Cu atoms. Microstructure, chemical composition, hardness, and tensile properties of as-built samples were firstly determined. The microstructure showed a dual eutectic formed by Si precipitates intermixed with \texttheta -Al2Cu phase. The average Cu concentration was 3.96~{$\pm~$}0.26~wt\% in line with the theoretical one. Hardness and yield strength of AlSi10Mg~+~4Cu alloy showed an increase of respectively 8.8 \% and 35.6 \% compared to the as-built AlSi10Mg, owing to the highly super-saturated solid solution of Si and Cu atoms upon rapid solidification. After that, a direct aging heat-treatment strategy was pursued to fully exploit the potential alloy precipitation by heating as-built samples at temperatures between 160 and 190~\textdegree C. A maximum hardness response was achieved after 1~h at 175~\textdegree C. The high hardening was primarily attributed to a mix of \texttheta ''/\texttheta '+\texttheta -Al2Cu and Si phases coupled with a still high solid solution content. Nevertheless, direct aging slightly decreased the alloy ductility due to the prominent precipitation of brittle Si particles during aging and the presence of Cu inhomogeneities formed after in-situ alloying.},

In modeling of solid-based processes, Discrete Element Method (DEM) is a very popular high-fidelity modeling approach which enables the tracking of discrete entities as they are processed inside complex geometries interacting with each other and with process boundaries. However, the computational cost of DEM models limits their applicability to simulation of specific and limited number of cases. In this work, we develop the DE\textendash ROM (Discrete Element\textendash Reducer-order model) approach which reduces the computational cost\textemdash while maintaining model accuracy\textemdash of expensive DEM models. The proposed methodology is based on Principal Component Analysis (PCA), combined with surrogate-model mapping and data imputation for the cases where there is missing information. The results of the application of the developed method to the powder mixing process, demonstrate that the DE\textendash ROM model produces accurate profiles of distributed particle properties in real time. Finally, the developed model is used for the identification of the optimal design and operating conditions of the mixing process.},

Interfaces between fluids of different properties, or ``colors,'' are represented as transition regions of finite thickness, across which the color variable varies continuously. At each point in the transition region, a force density is defined which is proportional to the curvature of the surface of constant color at that point. It is normalized so that the conventional description of surface tension on an interface is recovered when the ratio of local transition region thickness to local radius of curvature approaches zero. The continuum method eliminates the need for interface reconstruction, simplifies the calculation of surface tension, enables accurate modeling of two- and three-dimensional fluid flows driven by surface forces, and does not impose any modeling restrictions on the number, complexity, or dynamic evolution of fluid interfaces having surface tension. Computational results for two-dimensional flows are given to illustrate the properties of the method.},

Recently, there have been pushes to build neural--numerical hybrid solvers, which piggy-backs the modern trend towards fully end-to-end learned systems. Most works so far can only generalize over a subset of properties to which a generic solver would be faced, including: resolution, topology, geometry, boundary conditions, domain discretization regularity, dimensionality, etc. In this work, we build a solver, satisfying these properties, where all the components are based on neural message passing, replacing all heuristically designed components in the computation graph with backprop-optimized neural function approximators. We show that neural message passing solvers representationally contain some classical methods, such as finite differences, finite volumes, and WENO schemes. In order to encourage stability in training autoregressive models, we put forward a method that is based on the principle of zero-stability, posing stability as a domain adaptation problem. We validate our method on various fluid-like flow problems, demonstrating fast, stable, and accurate performance across different domain topologies, discretization, etc. in 1D and 2D. Our model outperforms state-of-the-art numerical solvers in the low resolution regime in terms of speed and accuracy.},

The addition of carbon prevents embrittled grain boundaries and high residual porosity by outgassing oxygen, trapping any residual oxygen in the oxygen-soluble Mo2C carbide, and increasing the grain boundary surface on which the oxygen is distributed. In this study, we investigated the grain size, tensile strength, and hardness of five different molybdenum-carbon alloys produced via LPBF at constant process parameters. Our alloys ranged from pure molybdenum to 2.2~wt\% carbon, which corresponds to a near-eutectic composition. In the absence of extrinsic nucleant particles in the melt, the relationship between grain size and solute concentration\textemdash and thus the growth restriction factor\textemdash follows an inverse exponential Arrhenius-type equation. We attributed grain refinement at higher carbon contents to increasing thermal and constitutional supercooling. The supercooling allows grains to nucleate and grow on the underlying solidified layer, where the fastest growth direction~{$\langle$}100{$\rangle~$}is better aligned to the thermal gradient than that of the epitaxially growing grains.},

To learn the correct interface evolution law, our neural networks are trained on phase field representations of exact evolving interfaces. The structure of the networks draws inspiration from splitting schemes used for the discretization of the Allen-Cahn equation. But when the latter approximates the mean curvature motion of oriented interfaces only, the approach we propose extends very naturally to the non-orientable case. In addition, although trained on smooth flows only, our networks can handle singularities as well. Furthermore, they can be coupled easily with additional constraints which allows us to show various applications illustrating the flexibility and efficiency of our approach: mean curvature flows with volume constraint, multiphase mean curvature flows, numerical approximation of Steiner trees, numerical approximation of minimal surfaces.},

In this work, we explore the implementation of an optical scanner in an industrial laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF) machine to detect powder bed and part-related defects. The sensor is mounted ''parasitically'' on the recoater and exploits its movement to scan across the build platform before and after powder deposition to obtain high-resolution images. The acquisition seamlessly integrates with the process, without delaying the production as the acquisition occurs in parallel with the new layer deposition. The system was used to monitor test builds as well as longer builds (1000+ layers) to prove its robustness to the challenging L-PBF chamber environment. The in-situ powder bed images of the new monitoring system were compared to the acquisitions of a standard external camera setup. The improved image quality and resolution of the new system were demonstrated on both large-scale ({$>$}1 mm) and small-scale features. The new system proved to be capable of capturing printed surface topography anomalies and powder bed contaminations ({$<$}100 \textmu m), opening a whole new range of possibilities for detecting small-scale defects via in-situ monitoring.},

Developed high-entropy alloys could outreach limited properties of conventionally used steels, ceramics and superalloys. The thermal and mechanical properties of refractory metals-based high-entropy alloys has been studied using a complex of analytical algorithms (linear, random forest and gradient boosting regression). The highest accuracy has been achieved by applying the gradient boosting model (above 91\%). Performed calculations allowed to verify the properties of different alloys, hence simplify their further selection for the manufacturing. From the developed ranking of overall properties make the TiNbHfTaW, CrNbHfTaW and VNbHfTaW alloys demonstrated the best results for being used in applications for mechanical and electromechanical engineering.},

We show that by deliberately introducing a high density of lack of fusion (LoF) defects, a processing regime that has been avoided so far, followed by hot isostatic pressing (HIP), we can print Ti-6Al-4V with reduced texture and combinations of strength (TS=1.0~{$\pm~$}3E-2~GPa) and ductility ({$\epsilon$}failure=20~{$\pm~$}1\%) surpassing that of wrought, cast, forged, annealed, solution-treated and aged counterparts. Such improvement is achieved through the formation of low aspect ratio {$\alpha$}-grains around LoF defects upon healing, surrounded by {$\alpha$}-laths. This occurrence is attributed to surface energy reduction and recrystallization events taking place during the healing of LoF defects via HIP post-processing. Our approach to design duplex microstructures is applicable to a wide range of AM processes and alloys, and can be used in the design of damage tolerant microstructures.},

Designing new aluminum alloys that can be processed crack-free by Laser Powder Bed Fusion (L-PBF) while exhibiting comparable or enhanced mechanical properties is a major target, which may be reached by including in the alloy design strategy specific features of this processing route such as the very high cooling rates. Here, we study a novel Al-4Mn-3Ni-2Cu-2Zr alloy processed by L-PBF, which shows some specific features in comparison to other Al-alloys developed for additive manufacturing. We establish the relationships between the processing conditions and the specific features of the microstructure inherited from L-PBF based on a multi-scale microstructural characterization approach from the melt pool scale up to the nanoscale using X-ray diffraction and electron microscopy with a special focus on Automated Crystal Orientation Mapping (ACOM) in transmission. At the melt pool scale, three regions have been identified: FEZ (Fine Equiaxed Zone), CZ (Columnar Zone) and CEZ (Coarse Equiaxed Zone) giving a hierarchical architecture to the microstructure. Each region has been thoroughly characterized by coupling ACOM and chemical mapping. Five different intermetallic phases have been identified in the as-built microstructure: Al3Zr, Al3Ni2, Al9Ni2, Al60 Mn 11Ni 14, and Al2Cu. The spatial distribution of these intermetallic phases has been found to vary within a given molten pool. The solidification sequence and the various mechanisms involved in the formation of this peculiar microstructure are discussed in the light of our multi-scale microstructural observations along with solidification thermodynamic calculations.},

Tracer particles were added to determine the velocity field using particle image velocimetry. In the case of pure ethanol, thermocapillary convection rolls similar to those reported in the literature were observed. The velocity of the flow can be controlled by local laser heating, confirming the thermocapillary nature of the process. Ethanol\textendash water mixtures show distinctly different patterns when compared to pure ethanol: the flow velocity of the symmetric vortices is significantly increased and almost insensitive to heating on the symmetry line. By heating near the contact line of the meniscus, the symmetric two-roll state can be reversibly switched into an asymmetric one-roll state with the flow at the interface pointing in the direction of the temperature gradient. A consistent interpretation is obtained based on the assumption that solutocapillary instead of thermocapillary forces is the main driving mechanism in the case of the mixtures.},

The aim was to investigate the effect of different shielding conditions on melting behaviour and bead profile in laser powder bed fusion (PBF). Through high-speed imaging, it was found that under an argon atmosphere a strong plasma plume is generated from the meltpool. Laser beam-plasma plume interactions caused strong instabilities during melting, including laser wandering, track instability and continuous fluctuations between melting regimes (conduction and keyhole). Hence, it was not possible to control the profile of the melted tracks under this condition. By using a helium atmosphere, a smaller plasma was obtained, reducing the disruptions caused by laser-plasma interactions. This led to a stable melting regime that allowed control of the melt bead profile. This condition was used to study the effect of laser-material fundamental interaction parameters on the bead geometry in powder bed melting. It was found that during melting of single tracks, the dominant regime of melting is conduction for the range of parameters tested. Penetration and melt width were found to increase with increasing energy density. For longer interaction times, melt widths were found to be up to ten times the size of the beam diameter used. Fluid flow modelling showed that this is due to strong melt flow as consequence of surface tension gradients generated by very high temperature gradients.},

We propose in situ alloying to accelerate the development of advanced and novel alloys, based on thermophysical calculations and CALPHAD approach, during the EBM process. We demonstrate our concept through the design and fabrication of high entropy alloys (HEAs). Three CoCrFeNiMn-xTi (x=0.18, 0.50, 2.00, in molar \%) HEAs are manufactured. EBM-built HEAs achieve a homogeneous distribution of elements while forming multiphase resulted from the hot powder bed. The topological structures formed by secondary phases contribute to the increase in the hardness of EBM-built HEAs up to 900 HV1. Considering alloy design, a systematic analysis on CoCrFeNiMn-0.18Ti HEA elucidates the microstructural evolution in detail. These findings provide a deep understanding of in situ alloying and pave the way to develop new alloys specific to the EBM process.},

  abstract = {Electroconvection is a multiphysics problem involving coupling of the flow field with the electric field as well as the cation and anion concentration fields. For small Debye lengths, very steep boundary layers are developed, but standard numerical methods can simulate the different regimes quite accurately. Here, we use electroconvection as a benchmark problem to put forward a new data assimilation framework, the DeepM\&Mnet, for simulating multiphysics and multiscale problems at speeds much faster than standard numerical methods using pre-trained neural networks (NNs). We first pre-train DeepONets that can predict independently each field, given general inputs from the rest of the fields of the coupled system. DeepONets can approximate nonlinear operators and are composed of two sub-networks, a branch net for the input fields and a trunk net for the locations of the output field. DeepONets, which are extremely fast, are used as building blocks in the DeepM\&Mnet and form constraints for the multiphysics solution along with some sparse available measurements of any of the fields. We demonstrate the new methodology and document the accuracy of each individual DeepONet, and subsequently we present two different DeepM\&Mnet architectures that infer accurately and efficiently 2D electroconvection fields for unseen electric potentials. The DeepM\&Mnet framework is general and can be applied for building any complex multiphysics and multiscale models based on very few measurements using pre-trained DeepONets in a plug-and-play mode.},

  abstract = {In this paper, the laser melting deposition (LMD) technology was applied to fabricate FeCoCrNi high entropy alloy (HEA), and the microstructure of the deposited HEA (FeCoCrNi-LMD) was systematically studied. The width of the columnar grains was found to increase gradually from the bottom to the top of the material. The top layer consisted of equiaxed grains. Tensile stress and compressive stress were applied to the material along and perpendicular to the direction of columnar grain growth, respectively. Electron Backscatter Diffraction (EBSD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were used to observe the changes in the microstructure and properties of the material under the applied stresses. It was found that the phase structure of the material did not change when the stress was applied, but the maximum polar density increased. After stretching, the Schmid factor decreased, resulting in strain hardening. Dislocations moved during the plastic deformation and their number increased, resulting in many small angle grain boundaries and subgrain boundaries. The dislocations concentrated at the grain boundaries, leading stress concentration at the grain boundaries. In addition, due to the differences in the distribution of elements between the grains and the grain boundaries, the properties of grain boundaries changed. Cracks were produced easily along the grain boundaries during the tensile test. Under the compressive stress (rolling), for the same amount of rolling deformation, as the width of the columnar grains increased from the bottom to the top of the FeCoCrNi-LMD, the size of the columnar grains increased. As a result, the columnar grains were inclined at an angle to the rolling direction, and the rolled specimen was bent.},

  abstract = {The layerwise production paradigm entailed in laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) offers the opportunity to acquire a wide range of information about the process stability and the part quality while the part is being manufactured. Different authors pointed out that high-resolution imaging of each printed layer combined with image segmentation methods can be used to detect powder recoating errors together with surface and geometrical defects. The paper presents the first study aimed at characterizing the accuracy of in-situ contour identification in LPBF layerwise images by means of a measurement system performance characterization. Different active contours segmentation methods are compared, and the sources of variability of the resulting measurements are investigated in terms of repeatability, part-to-part and build-to-build variability. The study also analyses and compares the sensitivity of in-situ measurements to different lighting conditions and laser scan directions. The results show that, by combining appropriate image pre-processing and segmentation algorithms with suitable lighting configurations, a high measurement repeatability can be achieved, i.e., a pure error that is up to one order of magnitude lower than the total measurement variability. This performance enables the detection of major geometric deviations and it paves the way to the design of statistical in-situ quality monitoring tools that rely on layerwise image segmentation.}

However, there are many quality issues that can be an obstacle for mass production. The in-situ camera-based monitoring and detection of defects, taking advantage of the layer-by-layer nature of the build, can be an effective solution to this problem. In this context, the use of Computer Vision and Machine Learning algorithms have a very important role. Nonetheless, they are up to this date limited by the scarcity of data for the training, as well as by the difficulty of accessing and integrating the AM process data throughout the fabrication. To tackle this problem, this paper proposes a system for in-situ monitoring that analyses images from an off-axis camera mounted on top of the machine to detect the arising defects in real-time, with automated generation of synthetic images based on Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) for dataset augmentation purposes. The computing functionalities are embedded into a holistic distributed AM platform allowing the collection, integration and storage of data at all stages of the AM pipeline.},

However, the proper selection of scanning strategies is still a key concern for SLM production. In order to quantify the influences of different scanning strategies (One-direction, Two-directions, and Pre-sinter) on the SLM process, this paper calculated the spreading powder process based on the open-source discrete element method framework Yade, predicted the SLM mesoscopic molten pool dynamics behavior based on the open-source finite volume method framework OpenFOAM, and established the simulation flow of the SLM multi-layer multi-path forming process. The influences of different scanning strategies on grain orientation, pore defect, and surface roughness were analyzed and verified in comparison with experimental results. It is found that the grain orientation of the current formed layer under scanning strategies One-direction and Pre-sinter was almost the same as that of the previous formed layer, while the grain orientation of the current formed layer under scanning strategy Two-directions was significantly different from that of the previous formed layer. In addition, the porosity and surface roughness under scanning strategy Pre-sinter were lower than those under scanning strategies One-direction and Two-directions.

  abstract = {Laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) is an advanced manufacturing technology that uses data-driven, layer-by-layer accumulation of materials to form metal components and has been widely applied in aerospace and other fields. Effectively controlling pore defects is a key scientific problem and technical difficulty in LPBF industrial production. Based on the open-source discrete element method code Yade, the particle distribution of the powder bed was obtained. Based on the open-source computational fluid dynamics code OpenFOAM, the pore evolution during the LPBF formation process at the mesoscopic scale was predicted. The thermal\textendash force factors affecting the molten pool included the surface tension, Marangoni effect, gasification recoil force, and mushy drag force. The laser energy model used a body heat source based on interface tracking. First, dimensionless analysis of the molten pool evolution in the case of LPBF single-track formation was carried out. The molten pool evolution was mainly influenced by the gasification recoil force, Marangoni effect and surface tension, and the main influencing factors on different zones of the molten pool were different. To examine the influences of the laser power, scanning speed, powder bed thickness, and hatch space on the pore defect in the LPBF formation process, simulations were carried out and compared with experimental results. When the volumetric energy density was too small, pore defects occurred due to insufficient fusion of metal particles, and when the volumetric energy density was too large to cause the ``keyhole'' effect, pore defects occurred because the entrained gas could not escape in time. This paper is expected to provide theoretical guidance for the scientific regulation of pore defects in LPBF production.}

EBCM and DMM take advantage of the strong non-linear phenomenon in the thermo-mechanical affected zone (TMAZ) by simplifying the temperature boundary conditions and optimizing the local mesh density, respectively. In detail, EBCM can reduce the difficulty of convergence in computing, while DMM can reduce the scale of stiffness matrix. The experimentally calibrated lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) firstly is used to produce the equivalent temperature function in TMAZ as the thermal input conditions of the FE model. The thermo- mechanical responses of several PBF deposits under different process parameters are predicted by the developed model, presenting good agreement with experiment data in terms of in-situ temperature and residual stress. Compared with the normal model, the novel high-efficient model notoriously cuts the computation cost without compromising precision.

  abstract = {Multi-laser powder bed fusion (MLPBF) has become the most promising technology for rapid manufacturing of large metal parts. As a branch of MLPBF, multi-laser array powder bed fusion (MLA-PBF) has gradually attracted the attention of the industry, because of its advantages such as significantly speeding up production efficiency and low technical implementation difficulty. However, there is currently a lack of simulation studies based on the mesoscopic scale to describe the dynamic behavior of the MLA-PBF molten pool. The MLA-PBF spreading powder process was calculated herein based on the open source DEM framework Yade, the MLA-PBF molten pool dynamics was described based on the open source CFD framework OpenFOAM, and a multi-laser heat source model for real-time tracking of changes in the metal-phase and gas-phase interface was proposed. Aiming at the single-line mode of MLA-PBF, it was found that the dual-laser forming with low-front and high-rear could be used to preheat and pre-sinter the metal particles that were about to enter the molten pool, which was beneficial to reduce the pore defect in the solidified track, and a moderate laser beam space should be used. Aiming at the multi-line mode of MLA-PBF, it could form a molten pool with a significantly larger width and length than in the case of a single-laser beam, which was beneficial to eliminate pore defect in the formed zone, obtain a flat solidified track surface, and improve forming efficiency. When the laser power was low or the laser beam space was large, a large number of pores were prone to appear in the formed zone. As the laser power increased or the laser beam space decreased, when the laser energy was sufficient to melt the metal particles located in the lower part of the powder bed, a smooth surface of the solidified track and fewer pore defect would be obtained. This paper is expected to provide theoretical support for deepening the application of MLA-PBF in metal additive manufacturing.},

  abstract = {Laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) has the advantages of rapid and customized production and has gradually been used in aerospace, biomedicine, and other fields. However, the current LPBF technology still faces many obstacles, such as the failure to fully explore the influence of the powder layer parameters (particle size distribution, thickness of spreading layer, etc.) on the LPBF multi-layer forming process. Based on the open-source discrete element method framework Yade and the open-source finite volume method framework OpenFOAM, the simulation flow for the LPBF multi-layer single-track process was established. Among them, the considered force influence factors included gasification recoil, surface tension, Marangoni effect, viscous force, mushy zone drag force, and gravity, and the considered thermal influence factors included gasification, convection, and radiation heat dissipation. In order to analyze the influence of particle size distribution and spreading layer thickness on the LPBF multi-layer process, the forming processes of the first eight layers of powder bed with three different particle size distributions and two different spreading layer thicknesses were calculated. Regarding the surface roughness of the formed layer, it was found that when the proportion of large-size particles increased, the surface roughness of the formed layer would increase. Regarding the actual thickness of the powder layer and the depth of the solidified track, it was found that they were mainly related to the thickness of the spreading layer, but were not affected by the particle size distribution. Regarding the porosity of the formed zone, it was found that when the spreading layer thickness was smaller, the higher the proportion of small-size particles, the lower the porosity of the formed zone; when the spreading layer thickness was larger, the smaller the proportion of large-size particles, the lower the porosity of the formed zone. This paper is expected to provide support for in-depth understanding of the effects of particle size distribution and spreading layer thickness on the LPBF multi-layer forming process.},

Currently, optical emission monitoring can retrieve information regarding molten pool characteristics, such as temperature, width, length and area which provide substantial process signatures. Nonetheless, a fundamental indicator for the retrieval of a complete set of spatially distributed information is missing: the molten pool depth. Within the present investigation, a system for the estimation of the penetration depth based on the detection of molten pool surface oscillations is reported. Initially, the fundamentals of the monitoring technique are presented. The principle relies upon the observation of molten pool surface ripples through the measurement of probe light reflections in the melt area. Proof of concept testing of the sensing principle was conducted through an experimental investigation on a prototypal platform. A monitoring system (consisting of a high-speed camera and a secondary illumination light) was employed to view the process while realising both bead-on-plate material remelting and single track powder bed fusion depositions of AISI316\,L at different levels of laser emission power. Oscillation frequencies were extracted from the high-speed imaging acquisitions after image processing and signal analysis. The surface wave oscillations were measured to be in the range of 3.5 to 5.5\,kHz in keyhole conditions. Metallographic cross-sections allowed to observe the effective molten pool penetration depth and cross-sectional area and were correlated to oscillation frequencies. Higher values of oscillation indicated shallower penetration and consequently a smaller mass of molten material.},

  abstract = {Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF) is an additive manufacturing technology which has been the subject of thorough research and successfully adopted in several industrial sectors. Among all the processable classes of materials, titanium alloys are especially interesting due to their favourable combination of mechanical properties and corrosion resistance. Most of the literature focuses on Ti-6Al-4V, although there are other alloys which are widely applied in fields that can benefit from the advantages of LPBF techniques, such as Ti-6Al-2Sn-4Zr-6Mo, thus far not investigated for this technology. This alloy is generally preferred to Ti-6Al-4V for the production of some components in the aerospace industry, mostly due to its superior strength. In this work, the most suitable process window for this alloy was investigated. Samples produced with two different combinations of process parameters, located in the selected process window, were then thoroughly studied in order to assess the effect of building conditions on the microstructure, phases and mechanical properties of the as-built and heat-treated material. To do so, an X-ray diffraction analysis was conducted with the aim of determining the phase composition and lattice parameters. Moreover, microstructural features, such as {$\alpha$}'' needles and {$\alpha$} lath widths, were analysed in order to correlate the thermal history of the process to the final microstructure of the specimens. Furthermore, the hardness and the tensile properties of the alloy processed by LPBF were quantified and compared with the data available in the literature relative to conventional manufacturing technologies.},

In some applications, the interest lies in the identification of significant differences in group functional means defined by varying experimental conditions, which is known as functional analysis of variance (FANOVA). With real data, it is common that the sample under study is contaminated by some outliers, which can strongly bias the analysis. In this paper, we propose a new robust nonparametric functional ANOVA method (RoFANOVA) that reduces the weights of outlying functional data on the results of the analysis. It is implemented through a permutation test based on a test statistic obtained via a functional extension of the classical robust \$ M \$-estimator. By means of an extensive Monte Carlo simulation study, the proposed test is compared with some alternatives already presented in the literature, in both one-way and two-way designs. The performance of the RoFANOVA is demonstrated in the framework of a motivating real-case study in the field of additive manufacturing that deals with the analysis of spatter ejections. The RoFANOVA method is implemented in the R package rofanova, available online at https://github.com/unina-sfere/rofanova.},

The aim is to increase the yield strength of Inconel 718 fabricated by SLM to beyond 1400 MPa, which has never been achieved before. In this study, various NbC additions (0.0\%, 0.5\%, 1.0\%, and 5.0\% by weight) were added in the powder bed of Inconel 718, and two types of post-SLM heat treatments were investigated, i.e., solution heat treated plus aging (STA) and direct aging (DA). With NbC addition, smaller depth of melt pool and finer dendritic cells were obtained. Both STA and DA promoted the precipitations of {$\gamma$}' and {$\gamma$}''. STA eliminated the cellular dendrites and induced grain growth while DA retained the as-built cellular dendrites, grain size, and nano-carbide from NbC addition, rendering a significant 326.2 MPa increase in yield strength. In this work, 0.5\% NbC addition exhibited a record-high yield strength of 1461 MPa and ultimate tensile strength of 1575 MPa for Inconel 718 processed by laser manufacturing process according to literature data to-date.},

In this study, Al-Ni-Cu alloy powder was subjected to selective laser melting (SLM). The SLM Al-Ni-Cu alloy was manufactured using appropriate printing parameters, and its properties were investigated. The results revealed that the As-printed material exhibited a typical melting pool stack structure, with an ultimate tensile strength of 725 MPa but a high brittleness effect (low ductility). After traditional heat treatment, the melting pool structure did not completely disappear. The strengthening phase Al7Cu23Ni precipitated from the boundary of the melting pools; thus, the Al-Ni-Cu alloy maintained high strength ({$>$}500 MPa) and considerably increased ductility ({$>$}10\%). The SLM Al-Ni-Cu alloy has considerable industrial application potential; therefore, increasing the heat treatment temperature or extending the heat treatment time in the future works can promote the decomposition of the melting pool boundary and solve the problem related to the aggregation behavior of the precipitation phase, thereby improving the fatigue life of the alloy.},

However, coarse columnar grain structures, up to the millimeter-scale, are commonly produced in titanium and its alloys through the layer-by-layer process and this causes significant anisotropy in mechanical properties. Here we report an innovative approach for microstructure refinement of an additively manufactured Ti-6Al-4V alloy via directed energy deposition of boron nitride nanotube (BNNT) decorated powders. With only 0.4~wt\% BNNT, this process results in unprecedented grain refinement down to a few micrometers and over 50\% strength enhancement. A unique texture-weakened structure comprising fine equiaxed grains is achieved via a novel nanoparticle-mediated nucleation mechanism enabled by local hypereutectic precipitation in the rapid solidification process. This mechanism is highly suited to the metallurgical environment of metal additive manufacturing and creates a pathway for screening effective grain refiners in titanium and other alloy systems.},

However, there is still room for improvement when compared with conventional manufacturing in terms of the predictability, quality, and robustness. Statistical analysis has proven to be an excellent tool for developing process knowledge and optimizing different processes efficiently and effectively. This paper uses a novel method for printing overhanging features in Ti-6Al-4V metal parts, by varying process parameters only within the down-facing area, and establishes a methodology for predicting dimensional errors in flat 45 down-facing surfaces. Using the process parameters laser power, scan speed, scan spacing, scan pattern, and layer thickness, a quadratic regression equation is developed and tested. An Analysis of variance (ANOVA) analysis concluded that, within the down-facing area, the laser power is the most significant process parameter, followed by the layer thickness and scan speed. Comparatively, the scanning pattern is determined to be insignificant, which is explained by the small down-facing area where the various scanning patterns play no role. This paper also discusses the interaction effects between parameters. Some thoughts on the next steps to be taken for further validation are discussed.},

Many factors contribute to the output quality of SLM, particularly the machine and material parameters. Analysis of the parameters' effects is critical, but using traditional experimental and numerical simulation can be expensive and time-consuming. This paper provides a framework to analyze the sensitivity and uncertainty in SLM input and output parameters, which can then be used to find the optimum parameters. The proposed data-driven approach combines machine learning algorithms with high-fidelity numerical simulations to study the SLM process more efficiently. We have considered laser speed, hatch spacing, layer thickness, Young modulus, and Poisson ratio as input variables, while the output variables are numerical predicted normal strains in the building part. A surrogate model was constructed with a deep neural network (DNN) or polynomial chaos expansion (PCE) to generate a response surface between the SLM output and the input variables. The surrogate model and the sensitivity analysis found that all five parameters were important in the process. The surrogate model was combined with non-intrusive optimization algorithms such as genetic algorithms (GA), differential evolution (DE), and particle swarm optimization (PSO) to perform an inverse analysis and find the optimal parameters for the SLM process. Of the three algorithms, the PSO performed well, and the DNN model was found to be the most efficient surrogate model compared to the PCE.},

A non-linear coupled thermo-mechanical model considering moving heat sources, radiation boundaries, elastoplastic materials and temperature-dependent parameters is adopted. Adaptive coarsening based on the background integration mesh is developed to efficiently model the layered deposition process. In addition, an efficient integration scheme using background hexahedral elements is proposed to evaluate the domain integrals of the weak forms. Numerical results show that the developed method is able to effectively model the AM process with substantially reduced number of approximation nodes. The effects of laser power, scan speed and scan path on temperature and distortion are investigated. The improved accuracies due to the proposed integration scheme and the adopted second-order approximation are also demonstrated.},

First, a phase-field model for thermodynamics of binary Al-3.3wt.\%Li was developed based on the CALPHAD database. The columnar dendrites with different orientation angles (0\textdegree -28\textdegree ), different grain sizes of equiaxed grains, and columnar to equiaxed transition (CET) were simulated. Then, CFD calculations were performed based on geometries from simulated microstructure features to predict the inter-dendritic pressure distribution. The RDG model and Kou model were used to evaluate the hot cracking susceptibility (HCS) of these simulated microstructure features. Comparing to the RDG model, our simulations have shown that the feeding pressure drop varies as a function of grain orientation, while it is a constant in the RDG model. It is found that equiaxed crystals with large grain sizes have high HCS due to their large pressure drop as well as the narrow liquid channel. The Kou model is considered unable to calculate the HCS of CET because the value of dT/dfs1/2 near fs=1 of CET and pure equiaxed crystals are the same. The predicted pressure drop of CET using our integrated model shows that the equiaxed crystals have a great impact on a the liquid feeding of columnar crystals when fs=0.51.},

In this study, a novel high strength metastable {$\beta$} titanium alloy, Ti-6Mo-5.5Cr-1Co-0.1C (wt\%) was developed based on laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF). It is shown that the as-fabricated material was dominated by mixed columnar and equiaxed {$\beta$} grains decorated by numerous fine TiC flakes. The precipitates were interconnected to each other and connected to grain boundaries (GBs) by dislocations. Solution treatment at 850~\textdegree C led to dissolution of intra-granular TiC and diffusion of C to GBs through dislocation pipes, which created vast carbide-free {$\beta$} grain interior areas that are good for deformation and promoted formation of bulk and polygonal TiC along GBs. The GB TiC particles acted as effective O getter of the matrix, which together with significant {$\omega$} precipitation helped stabilize the {$\beta$} matrix. As a result, {$\beta$} \textrightarrow{} {$\alpha{'}{'}$} phase transformation and mechanical twinning have been suppressed. The samples deformed mainly through dislocation slip and {$\omega$} \textrightarrow{} {$\beta$} reverse phase transformation. Ultrahigh YS and decent ductility have thus been achieved in the newly developed metastable {$\beta$} titanium alloy.

However, thus far the distribution and evolution of the thermal stress with different laser beams are rarely investigated. A block-by-block numerical model considering the laser scanning strategy and part-scale was developed to study the residual stress in MLPBF. As the laser beam number increased from 1 to 4, the residual stress at the top surface of the part decreased but the internal residual stress at the bottom center of the part significantly increased. The average and maximum stresses increased with the laser beam number, indicating that the cracks were more likely to occur with an increase of the laser beam number. The residual stress in the multi-laser overlap area was reduced, resulting in an important influence on the residual stress distribution. More frequent tension-compression stress transitions occurred during MLPBF, and the compressive stress along the deposition direction had a more important influence when the laser beam number increased. The simulated results agreed well with the experimental data. The results of the study provide a significant understanding of the residual stress and are helpful to the process optimization in MLPBF}

This study fundamentally investigated the elemental homogenisation and grain development in the in-situ alloying process of CoCrFeMnNi HEA, by analysing the basic units, i.e., tracks and layers, and introducing Mn as an alloying element to the base CoCrFeNi HEA. Different modelling methods were employed to predict meltpool dimensions, and the results indicated the dependence of the modelling on practical meltpool modes. Delimitation of elemental distribution was found in keyhole meltpools since an intensive flow was generated due to recoil pressure. The homogeneity of in-situ alloyed Mn in single tracks was insufficient whether operated in conduction mode or keyhole mode, which required remelting from adjacent tracks and following layers to promote homogenisation significantly. The preferred orientation in single tracks along scanning directions changed from {$<$}001{$>$} to {$<$}101{$>$} as the scanning speed increased, although the cross-sections were similar in size with identical linear energy density. Such preference can be inherited during the printing process and lead to different textures in three-layer samples. It was also observed that applying hatch spacing smaller than a half meltpool width could coarsen the grains in a layer. The results from this study provide structure-parameter correlations for future microstructural tailoring and manipulation.},

  abstract = {The keyhole mode in laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) additive manufacturing can be associated with excessive porosity and spatter, however, the underlying physics in multilayer build conditions remain unclear. Here, we used ultra-fast synchrotron X-ray imaging to reveal this phenomena. We in investigated melt pool dynamics, keyhole porosity and spatter formation mechanisms and their impact in all layers of the build. We observed that the transient melt pool dynamics associated with the keyhole include: (I) keyhole initiation, (II) keyhole development, and (III) melt pool recovery. Porosity and spatter were associated with stages (II) and (III). We also discovered that droplet spatter can form due to the collapse of the keyhole recoil zone, causing molten particle agglomeration and ejection during stage (III). Our results clarify the transient dynamics behind the keyhole mode in a multi-layer LBPF process and can be used to guide the reduction in porosity and spatter in additive manufacturing}

  abstract = {Steel matrix composites (SMCs), reinforced by ceramic particles, have received a consistent attention in recent years. Using conventional methods to prepare SMCs is generally challenging, and the mechanical properties of conventionally fabricated SMCs are limited. In this study, we successfully fabricated high-performance SMCs by laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) of a composite powder consisting of Fe-based alloy powder and submicron-sized WC particles. The effect of laser energy density on the phase formation, microstructural evolution, overall density and resulting mechanical properties of LPBF-fabricated composites was investigated. The present results show that a novel Fe2W4C carbidic network precipitates in the solidified microstructure entailing segregations along the boundaries of cellular sub-grains. The presence of this carbidic network hampers the growth of sub-grains even at elevated temperatures, and hence, stabilizes the grain size though prepared at a broad range of different energy densities. The exact distribution of the Fe2W4C carbides depends on the employed laser energy densities, as for instance they are more uniformly distributed at higher energy input. The density of LPBF samples reaches the maximum value of 99.4\% at 150\,J/mm3. In this parameter set, high microhardness of {$\sim$}753\,HV, compression strength of {$\sim$}3350\,MPa and fracture strain of {$\sim$}24.4\% are obtained. The enhanced mechanical properties are ascribed to less metallurgical defects, higher volume fraction of the martensitic phase and increasing pile-up dislocations resulting from the pinning effect by Fe2W4C carbide.}

The microstructural evolution and mechanical properties of the HEA composites fabricated at various processing conditions, were investigated. The LPBF-fabricated HEA composites showed typical hierarchical microstructure characteristics including epitaxially grown columnar grains, submicron-sized cellular substructures, nano-sized precipitates, and a high density of dislocations. The rapid solidification process inherent to LPBF resulted in micro segregations of Mn and Ni along the cell walls, which contributed to a pronounced impurity-drag effect toward the present dislocations. TiC1-x with a size of 35\textendash 100\,nm uniformly precipitated along the cell boundaries as well as inside the cells. Entangled dislocations easily formed around the cell walls and the nano-TiC1-x precipitates leading to a high dislocation density in the LPBF-fabricated HEA composites. The HEA composites with 1\,wt\% nano-TiC addition exhibited a promising mechanical performance readily characterized by a yield strength of 779\,MPa, tensile strength of 940\,MPa and an elongation of 30\%. The advantageous combination between strength and ductility can be attributed to the prevailing subgrain boundaries, solid solution strengthening, grain refinement, nano-precipitation hardening, dislocation hardening, plasticity and storage. This work demonstrates the importance of hierarchical microstructures of HEA materials via incorporation of nano-sized TiC particles for imparting exceptional mechanical properties.},

However, causality modeling and PSP relationship establishment in AM are still in early stages of development. In this paper, we develop an ontology-based Bayesian network (BN) model to represent causal relationships between AM parameters (i.e., design parameters and process parameters) and QA/QC requirements (e.g., structure properties and mechanical properties).

It is the first time that the dynamic behaviours of both the gas phase and powder particles during the spattering and denudation phenomena are reproduced in computational modelling, which agree well with the published experimental observation. The metal vapour spouts out and decelerates sharply along the jetting direction while expanding radially, which induces remarkable vortex flows of the ambient gas. With comparative simulation cases, the vapour jetting and the consequent vortex flow are demonstrated to be dominant in the spattering and denudation phenomena, and the thermal buoyancy effect is proved to be negligible. Moreover, the influence of the jetting angle is investigated: no remarkable effect within the range of 60\textdegree{} - 120\textdegree; while larger than 150\textdegree, the accumulation zone is eliminated leading to a completely exposed denudation zone.},

  abstract = {Accumulated spatters not only deteriorate the quality of the built parts in terms of surface roughness and/or density but also sabotage the whole fabrication process via damaging the powder re-coater. A cross-flow of inert gas inside the processing chamber is by far the only effective mean of removing the spouted spatters from the build platform. Despite the essential role, there are few efforts to investigate the interactions between the cross-flow dynamics and the spouted spatters, and hence, to optimize the design and settings of the cross-flow. Therefore, in this study, a coupled computational fluid dynamics (CFD) \textendash{} discreate element method (DEM) simulation framework is proposed to study the interactions between the flow field and the spouted spatters during the single scan process. The simulation results for the maximum ejection distance and maximum ejection height of the spatters were shown to deviate from the numerical results reported in the literature by no more than 15\%. Moreover, the simulation results for the distribution of the landing sites of the spatters were consistent with the experimental observations, which showed that a large number of large spatters landed near the scan track, while a small number of large spatters landed at a greater distance from the scan track. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this study represents the first reported attempt to use a coupled CFD-DEM simulation framework to investigate the spatter dynamics within an LPBF chamber and to validate the results with experimental observations and published data. The proposed model is an important tool to optimize and calibrate the cross-flow inside the L-PBF processing chamber.},

The evolutions of pole figures and inverse pole figures show that the full-density specimen develops a strong (111)/(200) fiber texture along the loading direction. For both LOF specimens, the evolution of texture is qualitatively similar to the full-density counterpart, but the development of the fiber texture was much slower, indicating a limited plasticity at a given macroscopic strain. The intergranular strain evolution in the full-density specimen is similar to that of a wrought 316L stainless steel. Conversely, a significantly different intergranular strain development was observed in a LOF specimen, where tensile strain development was observed in both the axial and transverse directions.

  abstract = {Laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF) is an additive~manufacturing process used to fabricate intricate metallic parts by melting successive layers of metallic powder. However, the fabricated part's poor surface roughness limits the extent to which the process can be used. The process involves rapid melting and solidification, and the unsteady flows within the melt pool dictate the surface morphology of the solidified tracks, which governs the surface smoothness of the end product. This work reports an experimental and computational investigation on the role of melt flow dynamics on the track's surface morphology. Single tracks were experimentally built by varying laser spot radius and scanning speed, and the corresponding melt pool and track surface morphology were characterized using metallographic and 3D optical profilometry techniques. Track formation is numerically simulated using an integrated 3D Discrete Element- Computational Fluid Dynamics (DEM-CFD) model. DEM is used to determine the spatial arrangement of the particles in the powder layer. In the CFD model, a free surface (VOF) approach is employed to precisely capture the interface between the gas and the metal phase. The interaction of laser with the powder bed and substrate, the physics of melting, solidification, and evaporation, and the melt flow due to interfacial forces (surface tension and recoil pressure) are accounted. With the help of simulation results, the role of melt flow dynamics on track morphology is described. Track roughness in the experimental samples is predicted with the help of multivariate polynomial regression analysis. The experimental and numerical data of track surface roughness and melt pool characteristics show decent agreement. Based on computational and experimental results, it was found that there exists an optimum scanning speed and laser spot radius which provide the minimum track surface roughness.},

  abstract = {One of the most significant barriers to the broad adoption of additive manufacturing (AM) is the qualification of AM produced parts. With the high market competition, quality has become the market differentiator for products and services. To maintain or enhance the quality of the products, manufacturers use two techniques, quality assurance and control. In fact, many researchers characterize the quality assurance and control as the biggest challenge to widespread adoption of AM technologies for metals parts in aerospace industries. One approach to overcome this challenge is to implement in-situ process monitoring and inspection systems to enhance the quality of the printed parts and AM processes. This has been highlighted by numerous research efforts for the past decade and continues to be identified as a high priority research in the AM processes. In this paper, we review current process monitoring and control systems for metal AM in Powder Bed Fusion and Directed Energy Deposition systems. And then, possible inspection system configurations for improving the quality of AM printed parts are discussed based on the proposed framework and requirement. A comprehensive real-time inspection method and a closed loop monitoring system are proposed to address the quality control for metal-based AM processes},

The Marangoni convection is caused by a negative temperature gradient from the upper to the lower copper plug, whose diameter is kept to a small magnitude of 3 mm {$\Phi$} to obtain a small Bond's number. By this way the micro-gravity effect in respect to the Marangoni convection can be simulated. From the visualization and the simultaneous measurements of the local temperature the range of the Marangoni number for the transition is determined. A strong correlation exists between the observed period of the oscillation of the branching streamline between the two vortices on the plane with the axis of the floating zone on one hand and the period of the temperature oscillation on the other hand. A model conception for the physical mechanism is introduced to understand this oscillatory instability.},

The quantitative multi-phase-field model provides an effective way to reveal the dynamic evolution of dendrites in the molten pool of EBAM. In this study, the thermal profile is interpolated from the macroscale simulation at each time-step, to couple the realistic thermal evolution in the molten pool. The microstructure evolution and competitive growth have been investigated in details. Simulations of dendrite arrays with the same orientation showed how the growth velocity and the primary spacing of columnar dendrites depend on thermal gradient and cooling rate. The results are in agreement with theoretical models qualitatively. Moreover, the Gaussian nucleation model was introduced so as to give a better prediction of the microstructure in EBAM.},

The modeling component builds upon earlier works by the authors and relies on the combination of two ingredients. First, a fractional stochastic partial differential equation is introduced and parameterized in order to automatically capture the complex features of additively manufactured parts. Information-theoretic transport maps are subsequently introduced with the aim of ensuring well-posedness in the forward propagation problem. The identification of stochastic elasticity tensors on titanium scaffolds produced by laser powder bed fusion is then discussed. To this end, we consider an isotropic approximation at a mesoscale where fluctuations are aggregated over several layers, and address both the calibration and validation of the probabilistic model by using different sets of physical structural experiments. Despite the high sensitivity of the forward map to applied boundary conditions, geometrical parameters, and structural porosity, it is shown that the calibrated stochastic model can generate non-vanishing probability levels for all experimental observations.},

The LPBF process boasts of manufacturing value-added parts with higher accuracy and complex geometries for the transport, aviation, energy, and biomedical industries. TiAl-based alloys and high-entropy alloys (HEAs) are two materials envisaged as potential replacements of nickel-based superalloys for high temperature structural applications. The success of these materials hinge on optimization and implementation of tailored microstructures through controlled processing and appropriate alloy manipulations that can promote and stabilize new microstructures. Therefore, it is important to understand the LPBF technique, and its associated microstructure-mechanical property relationships. This paper discusses the metallurgical sintering processes of LPBF, the effects of process parameters on densification, microstructures, and mechanical properties of LPBFed TiAl-based alloys and HEAs.

  abstract = {Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF) is a frequently used Additive Manufacturing (AM) technique for producing metal parts with complex shapes. One of the crucial factors in obtaining an optimal part is understanding the behaviour of the melt pool, a pool of liquid metal molten by a laser. Its size and shape are the result of a wide range of (processing) parameters, making it labour intensive and costly to identify an optimal processing range. To accelerate the identification of suitable processing conditions, this work presents a novel methodology that combines (semi-) analytical expressions of the melt pool width w and the aspect ratio R=d/w to compute the depth d over a large processing range. This range includes both conduction (R{$<$}1) and keyhole (R{$>$}1) mode melting regimes. The novelty of the presented approach is the prediction of absolute melt pool dimensions for both the conduction and keyhole regime. Furthermore, this methodology is extensively validated for three common LPBF materials: Titanium Ti-6Al-4V, Stainless Steel 316L and Inconel 718.

  abstract = {The objective of this paper is to quantify the precision of a novel approach for computational heat transfer modeling based on spectral graph theory. Two benchmark heat transfer problems with planar boundaries, for which exact analytical solutions are available, are used to determine the precision of temperature predictions obtained from spectral graph, finite difference (one-dimensional), and finite element (three-dimensional) methods. These studies show that the spectral graph approach captures the temperature trends in the benchmark case studies with error in the range of 2\% to 10\% depending on the location in the body. These verification studies also provide an approach to calibrate the numerical parameters in the new method. The spectral graph approach is applied for predicting the thermal history of a complex three-dimensional additive manufactured (3D printed) part. The temperature trends in a 50-layer part are computed 2.3 times faster than a commercial finite-element software package, and the results differ by less than 7.5\%. Further improvements in the computational speed of the spectral graph approach are expected through code optimization and parallelization. This work has far-reaching practical implications for predicting thermal-induced defects in a variety of manufacturing processes including casting and additive manufacturing.}

The heat equation on the graph is solved using matrix techniques involving the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the Laplacian matrix. The spectral graph approach precludes the computationally intensive meshing and numerous time-integration steps of the finite element method. In the present work, the spectral graph method is extended to include heat loss at the boundaries with a generalized boundary condition, and physics-based edge weights are introduced which simplify the calibration process. From this approach a discrete Green's function is defined which allows for solutions under a variety of heating conditions including: space-varying initial conditions; time-and-space varying internal heating; and, time-and-space-varying heating at boundaries of type 1 (Dirichlet), type 2 (Neumann) and type 3 (Robin). Results are provided for benchmark heat transfer problems in one spatial dimension and in three spatial dimensions, and verification is provided by comparison with exact analytical solutions and finite difference solutions. The spectral graph method converges within 0.4\% error of the analytical solution. The practical utility of the approach is demonstrated by thermal simulation of a multilayer additive manufacturing process. The spectral graph results are compared to experimentally-obtained temperature data for two metal parts, with error less than 5\% of the experimental measurements, with computation time less than one minute on a desktop computer.},

  abstract = {The dislocation dense cellular structures observed in additively manufactured (AM) stainless steels can allow these materials to have enhanced strength and ductility compared to conventionally manufactured materials. Effective design of radiation resistant materials often necessitates creating microstructures containing of a high density of dislocations that act as sinks for radiation induced defects. This work uses molecular dynamics simulations to study the impact of pre-existing defects on radiation damage in stainless steel 316L fabricated by the laser powder bed fusion process. The evolution of synthetically generated dislocations in a crystal system in response to multiple radiation collision cascades suggest that dislocation dense regions reduce the probability of surviving point defects forming clusters. This finding seems to result from the dislocation cores' ability to absorb point defects, thereby limiting the formation of clusters during the recombination phase. However, after successive cascades, the ability of the dislocation entanglement to prevent defect formation is diminished and defect cluster formation trends to an equilibrium. Accordingly, it is hypothesized that in an experimental setting the dislocation cells will initially act as neutral sinks for point defects, potentially delaying the onset of radiation damage effects; but, these structures will be degraded due to radiation-enhanced diffusion and lose their effectiveness at doses above 1.5-2 displacements per atom. Nevertheless, the ability to produce complex and feature-specific microstructures suggests promise for the design of radiation tolerant materials using AM methods.},

  abstract = {Laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF) as an metal additive manufacturing process that can produce fully dense 3D structures with complex geometry using difficult-to-process metal powders such as nickel-based alloy 625 which is one of the choice of metal materials for fabricating components in jet engines and gas turbines due to its high strength at elevated temperatures.~L-PBF process parameters and scan strategy affect the resultant built quality and structural integrity. This study presents experimental investigations of the effects of process parameters and scan strategy on the relative density, melt pool size and shape. Fabricated test coupons were analyzed with two objectives in mind: i) to determine how close each coupon was to fully dense and ii) to determine melt pool dimensions (width and depth) and shape for each coupon. The identification and definition of a dynamic melt pool has been performed, a condition which indicates that melt pool geometry is constantly changing as the laser scans and moves along a single track. In order to gain in-depth understanding of the laser fusion processing of powder material, an in-situ thermal camera video recording is performed and analyzed for meltpool size, spattering particles, and heating and cooling rates during processing of powder material nickel alloy 625. The results reveal in-depth process information that can be used for further validation of modeling studies and adopted for the industrial practice.},

The results indicated that the SLM sample with relatively high fatigue strength (580~MPa) was obtained. The excellent fatigue behavior was mainly contributed to the excellent combination of strength and plasticity as indicated by EBSD analysis showing fine grain sizes, high kernel average misorientation (KAM) and Schmid factor (SF) values. Both manufacturing defects (e.g., lack of fusion, pore) and the matrix can act as crack initiation sites, meanwhile, the former can be divided into surface and interior defects considering the defect location at the origin of fatigue micro-cracks. According to the scatter degree of the fatigue data in the S\textendash N curve, the difference in the location of original cracks showed a greater impact on the fatigue lifetime than that in the type of original cracks. The fracture mechanism of the SLM sample evolved from brittle fracture in the fatigue crack propagation zone to ductile fracture in the instantaneous fracture zone.},

In particular, we show that arbitrary decision regions can be arbitrarily well approximated by continuous feedforward neural networks with only a single internal, hidden layer and any continuous sigmoidal nonlinearity.

Correlative characterization encompassing X-ray diffraction, optical and scanning electron microscopy supported by electron backscattered diffraction, nanoindentation, tensile testing, and residual stresses measurements were performed on the as-built and heat-treated samples. The anisotropic microstructure of the as-built Co\textendash Cr\textendash Mo samples is imposed by the heat flow condition along the building direction (BD), parallel to the z-axis. Cracks and pores were found at the cellular dendrite boundaries and grain boundaries. Only diffraction peaks corresponding to {$\gamma$}-Co (FCC) were observed through X-ray diffraction. The formation of M23C6 carbides was experimentally confirmed by electron backscatter diffraction analysis and predicted by the non-equilibrium solidification path simulation. After the Co\textendash Cr\textendash Mo alloy was heat-treated at 1050 \textdegree C for 2 h, the previous cellular structures were dissolved. The tensile properties of the heat-treated samples were reduced due to the microstructural heterogeneities such as voids together with coarsened secondary particles that existed at the grain boundaries.},

The residual stresses are typically tensile near the top, while they are compressive near the bottom of the part. When it is removed without proper precautions, the part will bend excessively. In order to alleviate this deformation, a stress relief heat treatment can be applied. In this paper, such a stress relaxation heat treatment is modelled to investigate the effect of the post-processing parameters. The model uses an Arrhenius-type creep equation to simulate the influence of the heat treatment temperature and dwell time on the stress field in a relatively simple cantilever beam produced in Ti-6Al-4V. Via validation of the simulations, the effect of the heat treatment is shown to be represented accurately. The validated model is used to predict the deformation that results from the residual stresses after heat treating the part under various conditions. The results from the simulations ultimately allow choosing the optimal heat treatment conditions to obtain a given reduction in the residual stress level, while reducing the need for extensive experimental investigations.},

X-ray diffraction techniques along with electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were employed to investigate the microstructural characteristics and phase formation in the as-built and heat-treated samples. After heat-treating at 490\textdegree C for 6hours, the HighTi maraging steel showed higher strength and ductility (2057.74MPa and 4.05\%). The microstructural characterization proved that this alloy contains a higher amount of reverted austenite (17.89wt.\%), which resulted at higher strength as results of the transformation induced plasticity (TRIP) effect. In terms of ductility improvement, the fibre/copper texture developed in the HighTi sample provided a higher driving force to transform the reverted austenite to martensite. As the TEM analyses revealed, needle-shaped Ni3Ti and spherical Ni3Mo precipitates were found in both LowTi and HighTi alloys, where the HighTi one showed higher volume fraction of Ni3Ti precipitates, and consequently, higher values of tensile strength, which can be explained, based on the Orowan mechanism.},

  abstract = {Laser powder bed fusion processes are driven by scanned, focused laser beams. Along with selectively melting the metal powder, laser energy may be converted and transferred through physical mechanisms such as reflection from the metal surface, heat absorption into the substrate, vaporization, spatter, ejection of heated particles, and heating of the metal vapor/condensate plume that is generated by the laser-metal interaction. Reliable data on energy transfer can provide input for process modeling, as well as help to validate computational models. Additionally, some related process signatures can serve better process monitoring and optimization. Previous studies have shown that the proportion of the transfer mechanisms depend on laser power, spot size, and scan speed. In the current investigation, the energy conservation principle was used to validate our measurement of reflected energy, absorbed energy, and energy transfer by vaporization on bare plates of Nickel Alloy 625 (IN625). Reflected energy was measured using an optical integrating hemisphere, and heat absorbed into the substrate was measured by calorimetry. Transfer from vaporized mass loss was measured with a precision balance and used to establish an upper bound on energy transfer by mass transfer. In addition to measurement of total reflected energy, the reflected laser power was time-resolved at 50 kHz in the integrating hemisphere, which provided insight into the process dynamics of conduction, transition, and keyhole modes.},

  abstract = {Most wrought aluminium alloys of the 2000 series are difficult to manufacture by laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF) due to the formation of cracks during building. To date, the effects of processing regimes on crack formation are still not well understood. In this study we performed a detailed microstructural characterisation of crack development in the AlCuMg alloy AA2024 to quantify the extent of cracking and porosity arising from a range of different process parameters. Two samples, produced with different build parameters, were selected for in-depth study by scanning and transmission electron microscopy; these had similar low levels of porosity but high (H - 2.6~{$\pm~$}0.4~mm/mm2) and low (L - 1.5~{$\pm~$}0.3~mm/mm2) crack densities respectively. Based on distinct morphological features and characteristic length, we differentiate hot cracks from solid state cracks. Hot tears form at high angle grain boundaries and are associated with micron-sized gas pores as well as intermetallic phases in both samples. The solidification and cracking behaviour are modelled with the aid of a Scheil-Gulliver model that includes solute trapping. This approach predicts differences in hot-crack-susceptibilities, due to different solidification velocities, in line with experimental observations. The sample H, of high crack density, also experiences the higher cooling rate, and hence strain rate, which contributes to the greater propagation of cold cracks in the low fracture toughness AA2024. The observation of cracking associated with microporosity and the use of a Scheil-based solidification model, including solute trapping, provide new insights into the complex problem of hot tearing during L-PBF.},

  abstract = {Summation-by-parts (SBP) operators have a number of properties that make them an attractive option for higher-order spatial discretizations of partial differential equations. In particular, they enable the derivation of higher-order boundary closures leading to provable time stability. When implemented on multi-block structured meshes in conjunction with simultaneous approximation terms (SATs) \textemdash{} penalty terms that impose boundary and interblock-coupling conditions in a weak sense \textemdash{} they offer additional properties of value, even for second-order accurate schemes and steady problems. For example, they involve low communication overhead for efficient parallel algorithms and relax the continuity requirements of both the mesh and the solution across block interfaces. This paper provides a brief history of seminal contributions to, and applications of, SBP-SAT methods followed by a description of their properties and a methodology for deriving SBP operators for first derivatives and second derivatives with variable coefficients. A procedure for deriving SATs is also provided. Practical aspects are discussed, including artificial dissipation, transformation to curvilinear coordinates, and application to the Navier-Stokes equations. Recent developments are reviewed, including a variational interpretation, the connection to quadrature rules, functional superconvergence, error estimates, and dual consistency. Finally, the connection to quadrature rules is exploited to provide a generalization of the SBP concept to a broader class of operators, enabling a unification and rigorous development of SATs for operators such as nodal-based pseudo-spectral and some discontinuous Galerkin operators.},

The solutionizing treatment at 1260 \textdegree C induces significant recrystallization of the initial elongated grain microstructure, characteristic of L-PBF processing. Grain-boundary pinning by dispersoids affects the recrystallization efficiency, leaving behind pockets of fine 1-10 {$\mu$}m grains in-between 200-400 {$\mu$}m large grains with complex shapes. The Y2O3/Y2O2S dispersoids exhibit excellent coarsening resistance during solutionizing, and are stable during subsequent aging heat treatments at 850 \textdegree C. The slow cooling from solutionizing promotes the formation of secondary and tertiary {$\gamma$}' precipitates, with the ODS particles located within the {$\gamma$} channels. Within the timescale of the isothermal aging, up to {$\sim$}1000 h, the coarsening rate of the {$\gamma$}' precipitates is slightly faster in the ODS material. This allows to independently optimize the {$\gamma$}' volume fraction and size for balanced properties. Additionally, the capability of hot isostatic pressing (HIP) to close and heal cracks is investigated under various consolidation parameters. This post-process treatment allows to significantly widen the L-PBF processing window of the alloy.},

When processing the fresh, as-received powder in a well-controlled environment, the oxide inclusions contained in the precursor powder were the primary contributors to the formation of nano-scale oxides in the final additive manufactured (AM) product. These oxide inclusions were found to be enriched with oxygen getter elements like Si and Mn. By controlling the extraneous oxygen level in the process environment, the oxygen level in AM produced parts was found to increase with the extraneous oxygen level. The intrusion pathway of this extra oxygen was found to be dominated by the incorporation of spatter particles into the build during processing. Moisture induced oxidation during powder storage was also found to result in a higher oxide density in the AM produced parts. SS 316\,L powder free of Si and Mn oxygen getters was processed in a well-controlled environment and resulted in a similar level of oxygen intrusion. Microhardness testing indicated that the oxide volume fraction increase from extraneous oxygen did not influence hardness values. However, a marked decrease in hardness was found for the humidified and Si-Mn free AM processed parts.},

High fracture stresses of around 1700\,MPa and a reproducible plastic strain of about 0.5\% were obtained for cylindrical SLM samples. The analysis of the observed serrations during compressive loading implies that the shear-band dynamics in the additively manufactured samples distinctly differ from those of the as-cast glass. This phenomenon appears to originate from the presence of uniformly dispersed spherical pores as well as from the more pronounced heterogeneity of the glass itself as revealed by instrumented indentation. Despite these heterogeneities, the shear bands are straight and form in the plane of maximum shear stress. Additive manufacturing, hence, might not only allow for producing large BMG samples with complex geometries but also to manipulate their deformation behaviour through tailoring porosity and microstructural heterogeneity.},

The size, chemical composition, morphology, and distribution of the oxides were characterized as the function of heat treatment conditions. The study revealed the mechanistic driving force of the rapid oxide coarsening during recrystallization. Ostwald ripening governs oxide coarsening. The active grain boundary-oxide interaction at the early stage of recrystallization accelerated oxide coarsening via enhanced solute diffusion along grain boundaries. Pipe diffusion along dislocation cellular boundaries has a negligible contribution to oxide coarsening. At high temperatures (T~{$>~$}1065 \textdegree C), although lattice diffusion primarily controlled the oxide growth, the contribution from the grain-boundary diffusion was necessary. The transformation from MnSiO3 to CrMn2O4 took place in the un-recrystallized grains but was not observed when recrystallization started. The interaction of grain boundary and oxides during recrystallization resulted in a high fraction of oxides accumulated at grain boundaries. While oxide coarsening does not significantly alter the toughness value, grain-boundary oxides promote microvoid formation and intergranular fracture under Charpy impact in the recrystallized AM 316L SS.},

Undesirable residual stress and distortion caused by thermal gradients are a common source of failure in AM builds. A non-linear thermoelastoplastic model is combined with an element coarsening strategy in order to simulate the thermal and mechanical response of a significant volume of deposited material (38 layers and 91mm3). It is found that newly deposited layers experience the greatest amount of tensile stress, while layers beneath are forced into compressive stress. The residual stress evolution drives the mechanical response of the workpiece. The model is validated by comparing the predicted in situ and post process distortion to experimental measurements taken on the same geometry. The model accurately predicts the distortion of the workpiece (5\% error).}

The high sensitivity of thermionic emission to surface temperature and surface morphology is revealed to enable precise determination of the transition between conduction and keyhole mode melting regimes. Increases in thermionic emission are correlated to laser scanning conditions that give rise to pore formation and regions where surface defects are pronounced.

Competitive grain growth, relation between heat flows and grain orientation and the effect of laser scanning speed on final micro structure are discussed with details. Grains structure after laser melting is founded to be columnar with a tilt angle toward the direction of the laser movement. Furthermore, this investigation shows that the grain orientation is a function of conduction heat flux at molten pool boundary. Moreover, using the secondary laser heat source (SLHS) as a new approach to control the grain structure during the laser melting is presented. The results proved that the grain structure can be controlled and improved significantly using SLHS. Using SLHS, the grain orientation and uniformity can be change easily. In fact, this method can help us to produce materials with different local mechanical properties during laser processing according to their application requirements.},

  abstract = {A new Powder-bed Arc Additive Manufacturing (PAAM) processing which includes on-line remelting of deposited material has been developed for the manufacturing of high entropy alloys (HEAs) based on an existing AlCoCrFeNi2.1 pseudo-eutectic system. The remelting process is typically applied in the arc melting process to improve the homogeneity of prepared material. We investigated the microstructure and mechanical properties of produced AlCoCrFeNi2.1 HEA after applying a remelting process (1, 3, and 6 times) on each deposited layer. The results show the formation of the pseudo-eutectic microstructure, which consists of relatively large columnar grains of the dominant FCC phase ({$\sim$}90 wt.\%) and fine dendritic grains of the minor BCC phase ({$\sim$}10 wt.\%). The applied layer-remelting process shows negligible effects on the phase fractions and their compositions, however, it significantly degraded the tensile strength and ductility of prepared alloys. Particularly, the ductility of the alloy reduced dramatically from about 27\% after one time layer-remelting to only about 3\% after 3 times layer-remelting. This is rationalised by the significant localisation of thermally induced plasticity caused by repeated remelting of deposited material. We also show that this thermally induced plasticity leads to an increased amount of local misorientation in both constitute phases, which suggests an increased amount of stored dislocations in the microstructure. Despite the potentially strain hardening due to this accumulation of the thermally induced plasticity, the appreciable growth and constrained dendritic morphology of BCC grains that developed after remelting play a prevailing role on the materials strength, which limit the interfacial strengthening of the eutectic microstructure and consequently result in the loss of the tensile strength. The obtained results will assist in the further development and microstructure optimisation of novel HEAs using powder-based additive manufacturing processes.},

This work provided a heterogeneous integration monitoring with acoustic signals and images. Acoustic signal features and image features could indicate different states of the melting and then their signal features were extracted by deep belief networks (DBN) and convolutional neural networks (CNN) respectively. Heterogeneous features were used to recognize the sates of the melting by Support vector machines (SVM) method.Classifications were carried out with acoustic signal and image features respectively for comparisons. The optimal classification rate came from fused features from acoustic signals and images. The results indicated that the fused features improved the defect diagnosis capabilities for the SLM process. It is effective and promising by recognizing heterogeneous integrated signals for the in-situ monitoring of the SLM process.},

However, during the processing of DLD, the deposited steel layer is affected by the subsequent layer depositing. The DLD block shows different microstructure and mechanical properties at the bottom, middle and top of the deposited parts. To date, there are few research works about the effects of inter-layer interval time and laser power on the microstructure evolution and mechanical properties of the deposited layers. In this study, the idle time and laser power layer by layer during DLD of 12CrNi2 steel were controlled to cause the deposited layers to maintain a high cooling rate, while the bottom deposited layer was subjected to a weak tempering effect. Results show that a high proportion of martensite is produced, which improves the strength of the deposited layer. Under the laser scanning strategy of laser power 2,500 W, scanning velocity 5 mm{$\cdot$}s-1, powder feeding rate 11 g{$\cdot$}min-1, overlap rate 50\%, and a laser power difference of 50 W and a 2 min interval, the tensile strength of the deposited layer of 12CrNi2 steel is in the range of 873\textendash 1,022 MPa, and the elongation is in the range of 16.2\%\textendash 18.9\%. This study provides a method to reduce the tempering effect of the subsequent deposition layers on the bottom layers, which can increase the proportion of martensite in the low-alloy high-strength steel, so as to improve the yield strength of the alloy steel.},

Next, fatigue tests instrumented by IR camera were processed using heat source reconstruction to measure the mechanical dissipation due to fatigue damage. A statistical model was then proposed to identify the fatigue limit of the material. Finally, a practical application was performed to compare different manufacturing strategies using the same powder, opening perspectives for the rapid optimization of the printing process with respect to the fatigue performance of the parts produced.},

The current work proposes a~design procedure relying on the decrease of the brittle temperature range to mitigate the hot cracking issue and additional optimization criteria concerning the phases fractions and the solid solution strengthening to preserve the mechanical strength and some ductility. The optimization functions are included in an aggregated genetic algorithm for a rapid and efficient identification of the optimal composition. The algorithm determined a promising alloy, with a brittle temperature range of only 9~\textdegree C, and mostly constituted of FCC phase (around 90\%), with some Mg2Si and Al9FeNi precipitates. The alloy is found suitable for the LPBF process with no cracks observed. Hence, the criterion for the mitigation of hot cracking is validated. Mechanical results shown a high yield stress and ultimate trensile stress but an elongation at break quite low compared to conventional manufactured aluminum alloys.},

Three processing regimes (lack of fusion pores, conduction mode and keyhole pores) and three alloys (316L stainless steel, bronze (CuSn8), and Inconel 718) were selected. Three conventional ML algorithms and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) were chosen to perform the classification tasks resulting in five main findings. First, we proved that the AE features are related to the laser-material interaction and not from undesired machine or environmental noise. Second, the process regimes are classified with high accuracy ({$>$} 87\%) regardless of the algorithms and materials. Third, it is possible to build a single model from the three materials and still reach high classification accuracy ({$>$}86\%) of the different regimes. Forth, the AE features used for the classifications are material and regime dependent. Finally, with LPBF processing of multi-materials on the rise, a strategy for classifying the material and the process regimes simultaneously using a CNN multi-label architecture reached a very high classification accuracy ({$\approx$} 93\%). The results demonstrate the potential of our approaches for online LPBF process monitoring of different materials and regimes.},

  abstract = {Additive manufacturing (AM) enables the fabrication of complex designs that are difficult to create by other means. Metal parts manufactured by laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) can incorporate intricate design features and demonstrate desirable mechanical properties. However, printing a part that is qualified for its intended application often involves reprinting and discarding many parts to eliminate defects, improve dimensional accuracy, and increase repeatibility. The process of iteratively converging on the appropriate build parameters increases the time and cost of creating functional LPBF manufactured parts. This paper describes a fast, scalable method for part-scale process optimization of arbitrary geometries. The computational approach uses feature extraction to identify scan vectors in need of parameter adaptation and applies results from simulation-based feed forward control models. This method provides a framework to quickly optimize complex parts through the targeted application of models with a range of fidelity and by automating the transfer of optimization strategies to new part designs. The computational approach and algorithmic framework are described, a software package is implemented, the method is applied to parts with complex features, and parts are printed on a customized open architecture LPBF machine.}

  abstract = {{$\beta$}-titanium (Ti) alloys combined with high strength and good ductility have attracted extensive research interest for use in many advanced industrial applications. In this study, laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) parameters were firstly optimised to fabricate highly dense metastable {$\beta$} Ti\textendash 12Mo alloy with largely homogeneous structure from low-cost elemental powders. When the laser area energy density (AED) increased to 4\,J/mm2 under the simple scan mode, the refractory Mo powder melted and dissolved into the Ti matrix due to the increased melting pool temperature and increased cycles of remelting. However, when the same high AED was used in the chess scanning mode, keyhole-induced defects emerged at the island boundaries. The laser beam delay (LBD) and island spacing (IS) settings were optimised to eliminate keyhole defects. Additionally, it is found that using low and high AED (e.g. 1.6 and 4\,J/mm2), the builds show significantly different microstructure and mechanical properties. In view of this, a Ti\textendash Mo functional gradient composite (FGC) was fabricated via alternating AEDs of 1.6 and 4\,J/mm2 layer-wise. A gradient distribution of {$\alpha$}'' phase with varied size and quantities across the designed layer boundaries was produced. The Ti\textendash Mo FGCs possessed a high compressive yield strength of 1173 ({$\pm$}15) MPa and improved strain hardening capacity. The developed approach demonstrated the potential for the fabrication of FGCs using an in situ alloying based LPBF.},

With the reduction of energy density, the melting mode of melting pool changed from keyhole mode to conduction mode. At the high energy density, near-spherical pores were generated because of the evaporation of low melting alloy constituents. With the decreasing of energy density, irregular pores were generated, which was mainly caused by the insufficient energy input.

To take full advantage of modern GPU computing, a matrix-free preconditioned conjugate gradient (PCG) finite element algorithm with voxel mesh is proposed to solve the transient heat transfer problem involved in the L-PBF process. The accuracy of the developed simulator is demonstrated by comparing with a commercial software (ANSYS) using representative L-PBF process parameters and temperature-dependent thermal properties for Ti6Al4V. For efficiency, it is found that the process simulation has a significant speedup going from a single CPU to a single GPU implementation. A speedup is also observed with the matrix-free method compared to a linear solver using a sparse matrix, both on a single GPU. In addition, several schemes devised to gain higher efficiency are discussed in details, which include exclusion of inactive elements from the memory, adaptive meshing in the build direction, preconditioner, and layer lumping. Using these schemes, the adaptability and scalability of the developed simulator are demonstrated on a complex geometry. A calibration of the model is also performed in realistic conditions with a thermocouple measurement coming from experimental data.},

  abstract = {Measurements of the temperature and distortion evolution during laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) are taken as a function of time. In situ measurements have proven vital to the development and validation of FE (finite element) models for alternate forms of additive manufacturing. Due to powder obscuring all but the top layer of the part in LPBF, many non-contact measurement techniques used for in situ measurement of additive manufacturing processes are impossible. Therefore, an enclosed instrumented system is designed to allow for the in situ measurement of temperature and distortion in an LPBF machine without the need for altering the machine or the build process. By instrumenting a substrate from underneath, the spread powder does not affect measurements. Default processing parameters for the EOS M280 machine prescribe a rotating scan pattern of 67\textdegree{} for each layer. One test is completed using the default rotating scan pattern and a second is completed using a constant scan pattern. Experimental observations for the build geometry tested showed that for Inconel\textregistered{} 718 and a constant scan pattern produce results in a 37.6\% increase in distortion as compared with a rotated scan pattern. The in situ measurements also show that the thermal cycles caused by the processing of a layer can impact the distortion accumulated during the deposition of the previous layers. The amount of distortion built per layer between the rotating and constant scan pattern cases highlights inter-layer effects not previously discovered in LPBF. The demonstrated inter-layer effects in the LPBF process should be considered in the development of thermo-mechanical models of the LPBF process.},

This advance with respect to previous phase-field models is achieved by the addition of a phenomenological "antitrapping" solute current in the mass conservation relation [Phys. Rev. Lett. 87, 115701 (2001)]]. This antitrapping current counterbalances the physical, albeit artificially large, solute trapping effect generated when a mesoscopic interface thickness is used to simulate the interface evolution on experimental length and time scales. Furthermore, it provides additional freedom in the model to suppress other spurious effects that scale with this thickness when the diffusivity is unequal in solid and liquid [SIAM J. Appl. Math. 59, 2086 (1999)]], which include surface diffusion and a curvature correction to the Stefan condition. This freedom can also be exploited to make the kinetic undercooling of the interface arbitrarily small even for mesoscopic values of both the interface thickness and the phase-field relaxation time, as for the solidification of pure melts [Phys. Rev. E 53, R3017 (1996)]]. The performance of the model is demonstrated by calculating accurately within a phase-field approach the Mullins-Sekerka stability spectrum of a planar interface and nonlinear cellular shapes for realistic alloy parameters and growth conditions.},

  abstract = {Additive manufacturing processes, such as Laser Powder Bed Fusion (L-PBF), facilitates the manufacture of porous biomaterials structures, which can be used for example to enhance bone tissue regeneration. In-situ process monitoring techniques such as meltpool emission monitoring are increasingly being applied for the monitoring of the l-PBF processes. This paper investigates the use of statistical anomaly detection to analyse in-situ process monitoring data obtained during l-PBF. In this study a Renishaw 500M was used to produce porous structures, using Ti-6Al-4 V feedstock powder. During the l-PBF process, a co-axial photodiode-based process monitoring system was utilised to generate data relating to both the meltpool and the operational behaviour of the laser. Porous structures were created with intentionally defective layers, whereby the laser power was selectively reduced at specific layers. Control samples were also created where no intentionally defective layers were created. In addition, an un-intentionally defective sample was also analysed. The Generalized Extreme Studentized Deviate (GESD) test was employed to identify any defective layers within the structures. When this approach was applied to data generated during the processing of the structures with reduced input energy layers, the number of defective layers identified corresponded exactly with the known amount. When the test was run on the meltpool data, corresponding to the un-intentional defective structure, 30 layers were identified as defective. When examined, the identified layers corresponded to the physical location of the defect within the sample. The results obtained in this study indicate that the GESD test is an effective and computationally inexpensive method of identifying defective layers created during the l-PBF process.},

The methodology is applied to simulate the selective laser melting (SLM) of an Inconel 718 alloy using realistic processing parameters. We discuss the effect of temperature-dependent properties and the importance of accounting for different properties between the powder bed and the dense material in the macroscale thermal simulations. Using a two-dimensional longitudinal slice of the thermal field calculated via FE simulations, we perform an appropriately-converged PF solidification simulation at the scale of the entire melt pool, resulting in a calculation with over one billion grid points, yet performed on a single cluster node with eight graphics processing units (GPUs). These microscale simulations provide new insight into the grain texture selection via polycrystalline growth competition under realistic SLM conditions, with a level of detail down to individual dendrites.},

The in-situ SANS measurements during isothermal annealing reveals that the phase separation in the LPBF processed material proceeds at a smaller characteristic length-scale than the cast material. Quantitative analysis of the SANS data shows that, while the crystallization process in both materials proceed through rapid nucleation followed by diffusion limited growth, the LPBF processed material crystallizes with a smaller cluster size and at a higher rate. The smaller cluster size is attributed to the elevated oxygen content in the LPBF processed material which reduces the nucleation barrier and thus the thermal stability.},

Recent research on process monitoring focuses strongly on integrated optical measurement technology. Besides optical sensors, acoustic sensors also seem promising. Previous studies have shown the potential of analyzing structure-borne and air-borne acoustic emissions in laser welding. Only a few works evaluate the potential that lies in the L-PBF process. This work shows how the approach to structure-borne acoustic process monitoring can be elaborated by correlating acoustic signals to statistical values indicating part quality. Density measurements according to Archimedes' principle are used to label the layer-based acoustic data and to measure the quality. The data set is then treated as a classification problem while investigating the applicability of existing artificial neural network algorithms, such as the TensorFlow in the Python language, to match acoustic data with density measurements. Furthermore, this work investigates the transferability of the approach to more complex specimens.},

Strong relation between dependent and independent dimensionless products is observed. Inconel 718 samples were additively manufactured and a particular expression, in the form of a power-law polynomial, for its bulk density, in the working domain of the independent dimensionless product, was obtained. It is found that with longer laser exposure time, and lower scanning speed, better densification is attained. Likewise, volumetric energy density has a positive influence on bulk density. The negative effect of laser power in bulk density is attributed to improper process conditions leading to powder particle sublimation and ejection. A maximum error percentage between experimental and predicted bulk density of 3.7119\% is achieved, which corroborates the accuracy of our proposed model. A general expression for determining the scanning speed, with respect to laser power, needed to achieve highly dense components, was derived. The model's applicability was further validated considering SLMed samples produced by AlSi10Mg and Ti6Al4V alloys. This article elucidates how to tune relevant manufacturing parameters to produce highly dense SLM parts using mathematical expressions derived from Buckingham's {$\pi$}- theorem.},

We consider the capability to produce solid phase change behavior of the alloy in equilibrium and nonequilibrium thermodynamics as the primary required characteristics of an IP for the MAM process modeling. Two-phase {$\alpha$}-{$\beta$}, {$\beta$}-liquid, and liquid-vapor coexistence properties are used as the secondary criteria. Finally, we use other relevant single-phase properties as the tertiary criteria, such as the elastic constants at high temperatures, liquid structure factor, self-diffusivity, and shear viscosity.

Laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) AM is beneficial for many reasons; however, it is limited by the thermal solidification conditions achievable in the available processing parameter ranges for single-beam processing methods. Therefore, this work investigates the effect of multiple, coordinated heat sources, which are used to strategically modify the melting and solidifying in the AM process. To model this, existing thermal models of the LPBF process have been modified to include the effects of multiple, coordinated laser beams. These computational models are used to calculate melt pool dimensions and thermal conditions (thermal gradient and cooling rate). Furthermore, the results of the simulations are used to determine the influence of the distance between the coordinated laser beams in different configurations. The multi-beam scanning strategies modeled in the present study are shown to alter both melt pool shape and size, and the thermal conditions at the onset of solidification. However, these variations are not shown to result in alterations in the grain morphology of Ti-6Al-4V components. This predictive method used in this research provides insight into the effects of using multiple coordinated beams in LPBF, which is a necessary step in increasing the capabilities of the AM process.},

As a result, the exploitation of AM processes continues to accelerate. Unlike established subtractive processes, where in-process monitoring is now commonplace, factory-ready AM processes have not yet incorporated monitoring technologies that allow discontinuities to be detected in process. Researchers have investigated new forms of instrumentation and adaptive approaches which, when integrated, will allow further enhancement to the assurance that can be offered when producing AM components. The state-of-the-art with respect to inspection methodologies compatible with AM processes is explored here. Their suitability for the inspection and identification of typical material discontinuities and failure modes is discussed with the intention of identifying new avenues for research and proposing approaches to integration into future generations of AM systems.},

The finite volume method is a discretization method that is well suited for the numerical simulation of various types (for instance, elliptic, parabolic, or hyperbolic) of conservation laws; it has been extensively used in several engineering fields, such as fluid mechanics, heat and mass transfer, or petroleum engineering. Some of the important features of the finite volume method are similar to those of the finite element method: it may be used on arbitrary geometries, using structured or unstructured meshes, and it leads to robust schemes. The finite volume method is locally conservative because it is based on a ``balance" approach: a local balance is written on each discretization cell that is often called ``control volume;'' by the divergence formula, an integral formulation of the fluxes over the boundary of the control volume is then obtained. The fluxes on the boundary are discretized with respect to the discrete unknowns.},

  abstract = {Selective laser melting (SLM) is an additive manufacturing technology that has an extensively applied foreground and practical value in many fields. Despite its powerful manufacturing ability, defects are prone to occur and therefore a more reliable and repeatable manufacture process is in high demand. During the SLM process, the melt pool signature is the key to understanding the dynamic process status, with which it is possible to predict process failure and give guidance to real-time feedback control. In this paper, a novel method to capture melt pool signature using a U-Net-based convolutional neural network is described. A lightweight architecture was used to reduce the inference time, and an improved loss function with penalty maps was applied to better remove interferences. The model performance was evaluated by comparing both the processing time and accuracy with two conventional image segmentation algorithms, including the threshold segmentation method and the active contour method. Mean intersection over union (MIoU) was chosen as the segmentation metric. Unlike traditional algorithms, U-Net successfully eliminated the interferences, and reached the highest MIoU (0.9806) at a relatively low computational cost of 37~ms on average. The collected information from the melt pool area in various scenarios was analyzed, and its potential to indicate the problem of melt pool overheating was investigated.},

  abstract = {Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF) is an additive manufacturing process where laser power is applied to fuse the spread powder and fabricate industrial parts in a layer by layer fashion. Despite its great promise in fabrication flexibility, print quality has long been a major barrier for its widespread implementation. Traditional offline post-manufacturing inspections to detect the defects in finished products are expensive and time-consuming and thus cannot be applied in real-time monitoring and control. In-situ monitoring methods by relying on the in-process sensor data, on the other hand, can provide viable alternatives to aid with the online detection of anomalies during the process. Given the crucial importance of melt pool characteristics to the quality of final products, this paper provides a framework to process the melt pool images by a configuration of Convolutional Auto-Encoder (CAE) neural networks. The network's corresponding bottleneck layer learns a deep yet low-dimensional representation from melt pools while preserving the spatial correlation and complex features intrinsic in the images. As opposed to the manual annotation of data by X-ray imaging or destructive tests, an agglomerative clustering algorithm is applied to these representations to automatically extract the anomalies and annotate the data accordingly. A control charting scheme based on Hotelling's T2 and S2 statistics is then developed to monitor the process's stability by keeping track of the learned representations and residuals obtained from the reconstruction of original images. Testing the proposed methodology on the collected data from an experimental build demonstrates that the method can extract a set of complex features that are inextricable otherwise by using hand-crafted feature engineering methods. Moreover, through extensive numerical studies, it is shown that the proposed feature extraction and statistical process monitoring scheme is capable of detecting the anomalies in real-time with accuracy and F1 score of about 95\% and 82\%, respectively.},

The results show that there is no phase transition during annealing, but atom distortion occurs with the change of temperature, and the average grain size slightly increases after annealing. There are some atom clusters in the grains, with a few point defects, and the point defect concentration increases with the rise in temperature, and vice versa; the higher the annealing temperature, the fewer the point defects in the grain after annealing. Due to the grain boundary volume shrinkage and and an increase in the plastic deformation of the grain boundaries during cooling, stress is released, and the average residual stress along Y and Z directions after annealing is less than the average residual stress after prepressing.},

  abstract = {The multitude of influences on the Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF) process and local deviations from the intended process conditions can lead to the occurrence of quality deviations. The cyclic nature of the process could enable in-situ process monitoring systems to detect those deviations and to reduce the need for post-process quality control or even prevent defects by utilizing the extracted data for closed-loop or intermittent control. Most existing approaches are focused on the thermal observation of the melt pool or use matrix cameras to view the solidified material from fixed positions. This work presents an approach for in-situ process monitoring by leveraging the process-inherent recoater movement to obtain highly resolving images of the complete process area with a recoater-based line camera. A monitoring system is designed and integrated into a LPBF-machine. The system is calibrated and benchmarked to obtain images with a width of 97.67mm at a resolution of 5.97 {$\mu$}m/px and a recoater speed of up to 100mm/s. Details as small as 12.40 {$\mu$}m can be identified according to a USAF1951 test and the focal depth is sufficient to encompass the whole process area (part surface \& powder) of a typical LPBF process. Samples with varied conditions are produced and layer-wise images are acquired to evaluate the potential of the system under actual process conditions. Features relating to the brightness and periodicity of the images are defined and extracted from the image data. The relationships between the extracted features on the one hand and the laser power, scanning speed, layer thickness, shielding gas flow and laser defocus on the other hand are investigated and correlations are found. Overall, the findings indicate a high potential of the investigated system for the detection of deviations in the LPBF process and its future application for in-situ quality control.},

Post-build inspection is required to ensure the printed parts contain acceptably low defect concentrations. These inspections are time consuming and costly, especially for large or complex parts. As a potential solution, in situ process monitoring can be used to detect the creation of defects, characterize local material behavior and predict expected component properties. However, the precise relationship between pore creation and in situ process monitoring still needs to be understood. In this work, high-speed infrared diode-based pyrometry and high-speed optical imaging signals were used to monitor LPBF printing of 446 stainless steel 316\,L single tracks with varying laser power and velocity. Results indicate an increase in pyrometer signal and melt pool dimensions with increasing laser power and decreasing velocity in agreement with previous work. In addition, careful analysis of pyrometer signal reveals a distinct signature of the conduction-to-keyhole mode transition which was confirmed by metallography. Critically, pore defect initiation as characterized by ex situ X-ray radiography was correlated with in situ thermal monitoring signals to derive the probability of defect creation. Our results show that, in principle, a probabilistic prediction of pore formation can be achieved based on in situ high-speed pyrometry monitoring of the LPBF melt pool.},

This approach consists in using a high layer thickness in the core of the part, hence reducing the build time, and a low layer thickness in the skin, to maintain a high accuracy and good surface finish. The present study investigated to what extent this strategy affected the surface roughness, relative density, microstructure and mechanical properties of Ti-6Al-4\,V parts. Ti-6Al-4\,V specimens were built using two distinct sets of process parameters, one optimized for a 90\,\textmu m-layer thickness in the bulk and the other for a 30\,\textmu m-layer thickness in the hull. In addition to surface roughness and relative density measurements, a thorough microstructure analysis was done using both optical microscopy and SEM. Additionally, EBSD measurements and numerical reconstruction of the parent {$\beta$} grains were performed to evaluate the mesostructure and texture evolution from hull to bulk. Microhardness measurements and tensile tests were done to assess the effect of the hull-bulk strategy on the mechanical properties. This analysis was completed on both as-built and stress-relieved specimens. The present study demonstrated the possibility of using the hull-bulk strategy to build high-quality Ti-6Al-4\,V parts, without impacting their tensile properties, hence increasing the productivity of the process by a geometry-dependent factor, typically ranging between 25\% and 100\%.},

Current understanding on the three important issues including formation mechanism, influence and control method of metal AM defects should be updated. In this review paper, multi-scale defects in AMed metals and alloys are identified and for the first time classified into three categories, including geometry related, surface integrity related and microstructural defects. In particular, the microstructural defects are further divided into internal cracks and pores, textured columnar grains, compositional defects and dislocation cells. The root causes of the multi-scale defects are discussed. The key factors that affect the defect formation are identified and analyzed. The detection methods and modeling of the multi-scale defects are briefly introduced. The effects of the multi-scale defects on the mechanical properties especially for tensile properties and fatigue performance of AMed metallic components are reviewed. Various control and mitigation methods for the corresponding defects, include process parameter control, post processing, alloy design and hybrid AM techniques, are summarized and discussed. From research aspect, current research gaps and future prospects from three important aspects of the multi-scale AM defects are identified and delineated.},

Also with simple correction strategies, the problem could not be resolved. Incompressible SPH (ISPH) did not suffer from such instabilities and thus resulted in stable, reproducable results with lower simulation times in a GPU based ISPH approach.},

In this study, an Al92Mn6Ce2 alloy was processed crack-free without baseplate heating by LPBF. The high cooling rate during fabrication has a significant impact on the microstructure, which was characterized by SEM, TEM and XRD. The processing through LPBF causes a high amount and a strong refinement of the intermetallic Al20Mn2Ce precipitates. This leads, compared to suction-cast specimens, to a higher hardness (180 HV 5) and a higher tolerable compressive stress ({$>$}1200~MPa) associated with a pronounced plasticity without failure up to a strain of 40\%. The extraordinary mechanical properties of additively manufactured Al92Mn6Ce2 can extend the possibilities of producing novel LPBF lightweight structures for potential applications under harsh conditions.},

Fully dense alloys could be obtained by careful selection of the processing parameters. The addition of ZrH2 did not modify the microstructure of the alloy but introduced a dispersion of Zr-rich globular particles of approximately 50 nm in diameter which increased the strength of the as-printed material at ambient (23C) and high temperature (550C). Heat treatments of solubilisation followed by aging led to a fine dispersion of gamma" precipitates that controlled the strength of the alloy, which was independent of the addition of Zr. Moreover, dynamic strain ageing was found in the heat treated materials when deformed at 550C. Finally, the strength of the IN718 deformed perpendicular to the building direction was higher than that along the building direction, regardless of the heat treatment and temperature. Computational homogenization simulations showed that the anisotropy was associated with the strong texture.},

  abstract = {Due to the growing popularity of laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) as a metal additive manufacturing technique, there is a strong need to be able to accurately predict build outcomes. Full fidelity simulations of this process are not feasible due to the vast range of length and time scales inherent to it. While part-scale codes for simulating residual stress and distortion have shown reasonable predictive capability, they often neglect many aspects of the process occurring over smaller length/time scales, and thus are unable to capture effects of process parameter adjustments or the behavior of fine features. One way of capturing aspects at more refined length scales is through the use of adaptive mesh refinement (AMR). AMR allows for the process to be simulated at scales approaching the physical spatial dimensions without drastically increasing the total degrees of freedom in the simulation. This manuscript describes the implementation of an AMR algorithm within a multiphysics, parallelized finite element code, and its application to the LPBF problem. Part-scale examples are provided where the use of AMR has allowed for higher fidelity thermal and thermomechanical simulations, as compared to experimental measurements. Results from these higher resolution simulations show that while AMR is a necessary component for increased accuracy in a computationally efficient manner, other improvements are also necessary, including handling of the multiple time scales inherent to the problem and the need for improved AM-specific material models.},

In this study, Ti/Zr-based BMGCs with no toxic Be, (Ti0{$\cdot$}65Zr0.35)100-x-yCuxAly (x~=~5, 10; y~=~1, 3, at. \%, denoted Cu5Al1, Cu5Al3, Cu10Al1, Cu10Al3), were fabricated by selective laser melting (SLM). The effect of Al content on the microstructural evolution and mechanical properties were investigated. Compared to Cu, the increase in Al content had a smaller effect on the microstructural characteristics. However, for a constant Cu content, an increase in Al improved the amorphous phase forming ability and suppressed the precipitation of the (Ti, Zr)2Cu phase, enhancing the {$\alpha$} phase. The {$\alpha$}' and {$\alpha$}" martensitic phases precipitated in the {$\beta$} phase during the SLM process. In the compression tests of the Cu5Al1 and Cu5Al3 deposits, Al content was found to reduce the yield strength, increase the plastic strain, and improve the strain hardening exponent. Compared with the Cu10Al1 deposit, the plastic deformation capability of the {$\beta$} phase sharply decreased during the SLM process as a result of a large number of {$\alpha$}" martensitic phases precipitating and the formation of cracks in the Cu10Al3 deposit. Compared to Be, Al was not enriched in the residual liquid phase during the growth of the {$\beta$} phase, which led to a slow increase in the viscosity of the residual liquid and a weaker effect on the amorphous phase formation ability.},

It is known that non-spherical particles affect the particle packing process, however, there is a limited understanding of their effect on molten pool dynamics resulted from laser-powder interaction. In this paper, the non-sphericities in L-PBF were studied by extending an existing computational framework which consisted of a particle packing model based on discrete element method (DEM) and a meso-scale molten pool model based on heat transfer and free surface flow. Experimentally, by visually inspecting the scanning electron microscope images of Inconel\textregistered{} alloy 718 powder particles, the non-spherical particle shapes were classified into two main types: particles with satellite and joined particles. These measured non-sphericities were simulated using a multi-sphere approach in DEM to generate the packed powder structure on a flat substrate, which was imported into the heat transfer and free surface flow model to calculate the molten pool dynamics. The calculated melt track dimensions were validated against the respective experimental data for single track melting. The effect of non-spherical particles on packing density, molten pool dynamics and melt track dimensions was discussed by comparing the simulated results for real powder with those for idealized powder consisting of spherical particles only.}

  abstract = {Despite the great promise of the physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) in solving forward and inverse problems, several technical challenges are present as roadblocks for more complex and realistic applications. First, most existing PINNs are based on point-wise formulation with fully-connected networks to learn continuous functions, which suffer from poor scalability and hard boundary enforcement. Second, the infinite search space over-complicates the non-convex optimization for network training. Third, although the convolutional neural network (CNN)-based discrete learning can significantly improve training efficiency, CNNs struggle to handle irregular geometries with unstructured meshes. To properly address these challenges, we present a novel discrete PINN framework based on graph convolutional network (GCN) and variational structure of PDE to solve forward and inverse partial differential equations (PDEs) in a unified manner. The use of a piecewise polynomial basis can reduce the dimension of search space and facilitate training and convergence. Without the need of tuning penalty parameters in classic PINNs, the proposed method can strictly impose boundary conditions and assimilate sparse data in both forward and inverse settings. The flexibility of GCNs is leveraged for irregular geometries with unstructured meshes. The effectiveness and merit of the proposed method are demonstrated over a variety of forward and inverse computational mechanics problems governed by both linear and nonlinear PDEs.},

The fluid flow in the molten pool affects the solute distribution and the microstructure morphology when invar alloy mould is repaired with laser melting deposition. However, the effects of laser on the molten pool motion, thermal field and microstructure of invar alloy are not distinct. In this work, a three-dimensional model utilizing the volume of fluid method was developed to simulate the transient molten pool motion, heat transfer and fluid flow for the laser melting deposition process. The interaction among powder, laser and molten pool in LMD process was comprehensively considered in the model. The laser melting deposition with Nano-WC powder particles as a dispersoid was investigated. The simulated molten pool geometry was compared with experimental results. Moreover, temperature variation, fluid flow and their influence on the microstructure were analyzed. It is concluded that a significant Marangoni flow is observed with the highest velocity in the middle of the molten pool but lower in the surface and bottom of the molten pool. The lower velocity of fluid flow results in an element accumulation in the bottom of the molten pool. This study provides a referenced value for revealing the flow mechanism of molten pool in the LMD process of invar alloy.},

Particularly in the laser metal deposition technique, the dynamics and stability of the molten pool, both geometrically and thermally, have an impact on the microstructural properties and the formation of defects. This article presents a novel technique to track the molten pool in real-time. A middle wavelength infrared (MWIR) camera is used, with a spectral range between 3 and 5\,{$\mu$}m. The acquired frames are processed to reduce their dimension using a new strategy based on Superpixels. Traditional pixels are grouped into block-structures that are similar in temperature, optical flow, and spatial position. This guarantees a better adherence to the edges improving the segmentation task. Then, the optical flow of the molten pool is calculated. Throughout this tracking, geometric and thermal features are extracted. The proposed method was evaluated using qualitative and quantitative criteria. The performance of the proposal is compared against benchmark algorithms using standard metrics such as Sub-segmentation Error, Compactness, and Achievable Segmentation Accuracy obtaining better results. The proposal presented is robust to the number of superpixels generated as well as the size of the images. Which provides better performance for in situ monitoring tasks. Our proposal has significant industrial potential for monitoring additive manufacturing processes, as it requires minimal modifications to commercially available industrial machines.},

  abstract = {Wire and Arc Additive Manufacturing (WAAM) is a combination of welding and AM technologies and uses an electric arc as the heat source to melt welding wire. The mechanical properties of WAAM components are greatly dependent on the solidification behavior and microstructure. In this paper, a model composed of a macroscopic finite element (FE) model combined with a microscopic phase field (PF) model was constructed to investigate the Al alloy microstructure evolution during WAAM. First, the FE model was implemented to calculate the temperature gradient and solidification speed under different processing parameters. These results were then fed into the PF model to simulate the microstructure and concentration field of chemical compositions. The simulated results indicate that the moving speed of the substrate has a pronounced impact on the primary dendrite arm spacing (PDAS), which grew significantly as the moving speed increased, while the PDAS decreased slightly upon increasing the electric current. Furthermore, the solute distribution analysis showed that micro-segregation formed during the solidification process, and that current and substrate speed had evident impact on the micro-segregation ratio. Finally, metallographic experiments, energy-dispersive spectrometer analysis for element distribution, and miniature tensile tests were conducted on the specimens to validate the PF simulated results and obtain the relationship between process parameters and mechanical properties.},

The microstructural evolution before and after tensile test was characterized to explore the strengthening and ductility improvement mechanisms. Similar microstructures and tensile performances were achieved among the samples that were fabricated with different processing parameters, which indicates a credible parameter window for fabricating high-quality CoCrNi samples. An excellent combination of tensile strength and ductility was acquired (yielding strength: 689\textendash 700~MPa, ultimate tensile strength: 963\textendash 973~MPa, and elongation after fracture: 31.9\textendash 37.7\%), which were primarily attributed to the grain boundary strengthening mechanism and adequate working hardening capacity, respectively. After tensile test, most grains were rotated by aligning {$\langle$}110{$\rangle$} directions, along with high-density low angle grain boundaries. Besides, both deformation twinning and dislocation multiplication were activated during tensile process, which acted as dominant deformation mechanisms. The findings above reveal that LPBF can fabricate high-quality CoCrNi MEAs with cellular and columnar sub-structures, and an excellent tensile strength without sacrificing ductility.},

The extreme process conditions, in particular the high temperature, complex interactions and couplings, and rich metallurgical transformations that this process entails, are at the origin of numerous process defects. Therefore, the numerical simulation of the process is gaining the interest of both the scientific and the industrial communities. However, simulating that process demands impressive computational resources, limiting high resolution simulations to the microscopic and mesoscopic scales. This paper proposes a thermo-mechanical modeling framework at the process scale as well as its associated reduced order simulation counterpart, enabling the parametric evaluation of the part distortion. It deeply addresses the process calibration using a high-resolution computational procedure based on the use of an in-plane-out-of-plane separated representation at the heart of the so-called Proper Generalized Decomposition (PGD), as well as the analysis of the transient thermal effects, defining the conditions in which the thermal and mechanical analyses can be decoupled.},

In this paper, we focus on probabilistic modeling which can combine experimental data with simulation data in an efficient manner to: a) accelerate the parameter development processes associated with laser powder bed fusion additive manufacturing process of metals, and b) quantify uncertainty and identify missing physics in the simulation.

  abstract = {A new class of crack-resistant nickel-based superalloy containing high \$\textbackslash gamma\^\textbackslash prime\$ fraction is studied for the laser-powder bed fusion (L-PBF) process. The effects of the (Nb+Ta)/Al ratio is emphasised, a strategy that is shown to confer excellent low-temperature strength whilst maintaining oxidation resistance at high temperatures via stable alumina scale formation. The processability of the new alloys is characterised with respect to defect assessment by micro-focus x-ray computed tomography; use is made of a prototype turbine blade geometry and the heritage alloy CM247LC as a benchmark. In all cases, some processing-related porosity is present in thin wall sections such as the trailing edge, but this can be avoided by judicious processing. The cracking seen in CM247LC -- in solid-state, liquation and solidification forms -- is avoided. A novel sub-solvus heat treatment strategy is proposed which takes advantage of AM not requiring solutioning; super-solvus heat treatment is inappropriate since it embrittles the material by deterioration of the texture and coarsening of grain boundary carbides. The tensile strength of the new superalloy is greatest when the Nb+Ta content is highest and exceeds that of CM247LC up to \$\textbackslash sim\$900\$\textbackslash,\$\$\^\textbackslash circ\$C. The oxidation resistance is best when Al content is highest, and oxidation-assisted cracking resistance maximized when the (Nb+Ta)/Al ratio is balanced. In all cases these are equivalent or superior to that of CM247LC. Nevertheless, the creep resistance of the new alloys is somewhat inferior to that of CM247LC for which the \$\textbackslash gamma\^\textbackslash prime\$, C, and B contents are higher; this implies a processing/property trade-off which requires further clarification.},

Elemental Al+Sc(+Zr) powder blends were processed by laser powder bed fusion into Al-Sc and Al-Sc-Zr alloys, with operando X-ray diffraction at the Swiss Light Source extracting the structural and thermal history of the process. The pure Sc and Zr particles were found to react with the molten Al pool at 550-650 \textdegree C, well below their respective melting temperatures. Various scan areas (1\texttimes 1, 2\texttimes 2, 4\texttimes 4, and 8\texttimes 2 mm2) were studied to compare (i) the base plate ``preheating'' effect caused by prior laser scans, (ii) the return temperature reached after the melting scan and before the following scan, (iii) the initial cooling rate immediately after solidification, and (iv) the time spent in the ``intrinsic heat treatment range'', defined as 300-650 \textdegree C, where secondary precipitation occurs. Microstructural analysis of the as-built samples show 110-140nm L12-Al3(Sc,Zr) primary precipitates at the bottom of the melt pool. The 1\texttimes 1 mm2 samples exhibit the most elongated grains (long axis of 10 {$\pm$} 5\textmu m), which correlates with the highest build plate temperature and the slowest initial cooling rate (3-5 \texttimes{} 105K/s).

This study investigates elemental alloying elements (Sc and Zr) which are high-melting and highly reactive, unlike previous work which focused on more concentrated elemental additions of lower-melting, lower-reactivity Cu and Si to aluminum. High-speed in situ synchrotron x-ray imaging and diffraction show that the 20-30 {$\mu$}m Al, Sc, and Zr powders fully melt and sufficiently mix in the molten state to create, on solidification, a homogeneous distribution of primary, micron-size L12 precipitates (Al3Sc, Al3Zr, and Al3(Sc,Zr), respectively) and nucleate micron-size Al matrix grains, as confirmed by SEM imaging of cross-sections. A second laser pass, simulating a realistic additive-manufacturing build condition, fully remelts the initial volume which shows, after solidification, the same Al3(Sc,Zr) L12 primary micro-precipitates and very fine Al grains. After aging at 300-400\textdegree C, the alloys show large increases in hardness, consistent with an exceptionally high number density (1.4 \texttimes{} 1024 m-3) and volume fraction (2.5\%) of secondary Al3(Sc,Zr) nano-precipitates with a Sc-rich core and Zr-rich shell, as measured via atom-probe tomography.},

All these experimental results were obtained with new initialization or training mechanisms. Our objective here is to understand better why standard gradient descent from random initialization is doing so poorly with deep neural networks, to better understand these recent relative successes and help design better algorithms in the future.  We first observe the influence of the non-linear activations functions. We find that the logistic sigmoid activation is unsuited for deep networks with random initialization because of its mean value, which can drive especially the top hidden layer into saturation. Surprisingly, we find that saturated units can move out of saturation by themselves, albeit slowly, and explaining the plateaus sometimes seen when training neural networks. We find that a new non-linearity that saturates less can often be beneficial. Finally, we study how activations and gradients vary across layers and during training, with the idea that training may be more difficult when the singular values of the Jacobian associated with each layer are far from 1.  Based on these considerations, we propose a new initialization scheme that brings substantially faster convergence.},

  abstract = {Process monitoring in additive manufacturing (AM) is a crucial component in the mission of broadening AM industrialization. However, conventional part evaluation and qualification techniques, such as computed tomography (CT), can only be utilized after the build is complete, and thus eliminate any potential to correct defects during the build process. In contrast to post-build CT, in situ defect detection based on in situ sensing, such as layerwise visual inspection, enables the potential for in-process re-melting and correction of detected defects and thus facilitates in-process part qualification. This paper describes the development and implementation of such an in situ defect detection strategy for powder bed fusion (PBF) AM using supervised machine learning. During the build process, multiple images were collected at each build layer using a high resolution digital single-lens reflex (DSLR) camera. For each neighborhood in the resulting layerwise image stack, multi-dimensional visual features were extracted and evaluated using binary classification techniques, i.e. a linear support vector machine (SVM). Through binary classification, neighborhoods are then categorized as either a flaw, i.e. an undesirable interruption in the typical structure of the material, or a nominal build condition. Ground truth labels, i.e. the true location of flaws and nominal build areas, which are needed to train the binary classifiers, were obtained from post-build high-resolution 3D CT scan data. In CT scans, discontinuities, e.g. incomplete fusion, porosity, cracks, or inclusions, were identified using automated analysis tools or manual inspection. The xyz locations of the CT data were transferred into the layerwise image domain using an affine transformation, which was estimated using reference points embedded in the part. After the classifier had been properly trained, in situ defect detection accuracies greater than 80\% were demonstrated during cross-validation experiments.},

The analysis of the surface topography was conducted based on the classical approach in accordance with the current standard and with the use of multiscale methods; i.e., wavelet transformation and geometric via curvature. Selective laser melting 3D printing technology was used to produce samples for surface testing. Furthermore, additional assessment of surfaces created as result of milling was conducted. Statistical research demonstrated a differentiation in the distribution of particular morphological features in certain ranges of the analyzed scales.},

Preserving the topological information of CAD model eliminates the geometrical errors generated due to the approximations in the tessellation process. Additionally, the topological information can be used in the process of layer thickness selection, slicing, material deposition and post-processing to more accurately and efficiently determine their parameters. The potential advantages of implementing the direct usage of CAD data are the controllability and the scalability of the process which is highly crucial in the micro and Nano AM processes. A case study is presented in this paper in which a direct slicing procedure is implemented to find layer contours directly from the CAD model.},

  abstract = {With the implementation of Laser Powder Bed Fusion technologies for industrial production, the need for in-process monitoring has emerged to ensure stable conditions and the process to succeed. Indeed, despite significant technological advances, the rejected parts are still too high if compared to the more conventional manufacturing techniques. Several defects are known to affect the process, more likely when complex geometries are fabricated. Among these, the production of inclined thin walls without support structures is still critical and, in most cases, geometric distortions are observed on the overhanging surfaces. In order to overcome the above mentioned problems and improve the quality of these critical structures, an high resolution monitoring system based on Optical Tomography (OT) was proposed, called High Resolution-Optical Tomography (HR-OT). It uses a very high-resolution sensor, operating in the visible spectrum of light, on a large area of the surface layers comprising the entire printing platform. This very recent technique, typically applied for the detection of volumetric defects, such as porosity or lack of fusion, was successfully applied, in this paper, for the detection of geometric distortions, allowing to avoid onerous pre-processing phases in the image processing workflow. Specific geometric indexes were selected as monitoring outputs and were used for the construction of appropriate control charts in order to carry out statistical process monitoring. Finally, an off-line 3D reconstruction, by means of digital close range photogrammetry, was used to verify the effectiveness of the proposed monitoring solution when applied for in-process detection of geometric distortions.},

With two different protective gases (Argon and Nitrogen), a new type of high entropy alloy CoCr2.5FeNi2TiW0.5 has been prepared by selective laser melting (SLM) technology for additive manufacturing with discussion and analysis on the influence of microstructure and mechanical properties in this paper. Under the protection of argon (Ar), the HEA forms a single-phase solid solution. Meanwhile, the second phase TiN is formed when nitrogen (N2) is used as protective gas, which eventually becomes the matrix body-centered cubic (BCC) with precipitates TiN. The average microhardness values of samples under the protection of Ar and N2 were 436.7HV and 499.2HV, respectively. Along the scanning direction, the SLM sample (N2 protection) shows higher properties on the average yield strength (YS), ultimate tensile strength (UTS), and average elongation of samples (581MPa, 893MPa, and 9.9\%, respectively.), compared with those obtained under Ar atmosphere. This method could effectively refine grain structure and offer theoretical guidance to manufacture fine grain materials with high strength and ductility of new HEA components.},

Along these lines, in this work, bulk VNbMoTaW RHEA on a tungsten substrate was fabricated by enforcing the selective laser melting (SLM) technique. The impact of the laser scanning speed on the surface morphology, internal defect, microstructure and mechanical properties of the VNbMoTaW RHEA specimen were thoroughly investigated. The extracted results showed that the pores and cracks were the main sources of defects within SLMed VNbMoTaW RHEA. Interestingly, the pores disappeared when a lower scanning speed was applied. However, the manifestation of cracks was inevitable regardless of the employed scanning speed. The microstructure of the VNbMoTaW RHEA was observed in cross-section, indicating the existence of a columnar dendritic structure, which revealed the existence of a strong epitaxial growth along the building direction. In addition, the typical microstructure feature of the VNbMoTaW RHEA on the top surface was cellular structure. The average microhardness of the VNbMoTaW RHEA fabricated by the SLM method was about 664\,HV, which was 1.3 times higher than that processed by arc-melting (525\,HV). Moreover, the surface of the VNbMoTaW RHEA specimen was subjected to tensile residual stress, which gradually decreased as the laser scanning speed was increased. The VNbMoTaW RHEA specimens prepared by SLM exhibit higher compressive strength than the corresponding specimens, which were prepared by enforcing the vacuum arc melting procedure.},

  abstract = {Selective laser melting (SLM) is a promising powder-based additive manufacturing technology due to its capability to fabricate metallic components with complex geometries. While most previous investigations focus on printing with a single material, recent industry-orientated studies indicate the need for multi-material SLM in several high-value manufacturing sectors including medical devices, aerospace and automotive industries. However, understanding the underlying physics in multi-material SLM remains challenging due to the difficulties of experimental observation. In this paper, an integrated modelling framework for multi-track, multi-layer and multi-material SLM is developed to advance the in-depth understanding of this process. The main novelty is in modelling the molten pool evolvement and track morphology of multiple materials deposited on the same and across different layers. Discrete element method (DEM) is employed to reproduce the powder deposition process of multiple materials in different deposition patterns, with particle size distribution imported from a particle size analyser. Various phenomena including balling effect, keyhole depression, and lack of fusion between layers are investigated with different laser energy inputs. As a result of the different thermal properties, several process parameters including energy density and hatch spacing are optimised for different powder materials to obtain a continuous track profile and improved scanning efficiency. The interface between two layers of different materials is visualised by simulation; it was found that the phase migration at the interface is related to the convection flow inside the molten pool, which contributes to the mixing of the two materials and elemental diffusion. This study significantly contributes to the challenging area of multi-material additive manufacturing by providing a greater in-depth understanding of the SLM process from multi-material powder deposition to laser interaction with powders across multiple scanning tracks and different building layers than can be achieved by experimentation alone.},

However, the forming mechanisms of various defects remain unknown. In this paper, a DEM-CFD model was first established to obtain an in-depth understanding of this process. It was discovered that the defects including partially melted and un-melted Invar36 powder were embedded in the lower level of the powder layer; this was attributed to the low laser absorptivity, low melting point and high thermal conductivity of the Cu10Sn powder. Inter-layer defects were more likely to occur with an increased powder layer thickness. In addition, the scanned track width was found related to an equilibrium achieved among the thermal properties of the powder mixture. Process parameters were optimised to obtain FGM structures without defects in both horizontal and vertical directions. Invar36/Cu10Sn samples were fabricated with a multi-material LPBF system using different mixed powder contents and laser volumetric energy densities (VEDs). By increasing the VED, fewer defects were observed between the interface of two processed powder layers, which had a good agreement with the modelling results.},

  abstract = {Selective laser melting (SLM) is a promising metal additive manufacturing technology, which holds widespread applications in numerous fields. Unfortunately, it is arduous to predict the real SLM part geometry, which impedes its further development. While the morphology of melt pool, influenced and determined by process parameters, poses a crucial influence on the overall part geometry. Nonetheless, the association between process parameters and melt pool morphology is still unclear. Hence it is indispensable to explore relevant solution to address this issue. For this purpose, this paper proposes a new model to directly establish the mathematical relationship between process parameters and melt pool structure for SLM process. In this model, the status of melt pool is first qualitatively analyzed via the defined synthetic process index, and three types of melting states are differentiated including low melting, intermediate melting and high melting, which could cover different melt pool modes. Then, the computational model involving more physical mechanisms integrating mass conversion, heat exchange and temperature field is constructed. Melt pool critical geometries including the height, width, depth and length could be computed through the model. In order to validate the correctness of the proposed model, published experimental observations and existing models are compared. Calculation results from the proposed model show high consistency with the experimental samples and better accuracy than existing empirical models. Its applicability in melt pool classification and prediction is also verified, laying foundation for geometric simulation of SLM object which is successively shaped melt-pool by melt-pool.},

However, the inherent ``black box'' nature of ML techniques such as those represented by artificial neural networks has often presented a challenge to interpret ML outcomes in the framework of the complex thermodynamics that govern AM. While the practical benefits of ML provide an adequate justification, its utility as a reliable modeling tool is ultimately reliant on assured consistency with physical principles and model transparency. To facilitate the fundamental needs, physics-informed machine learning (PIML) has emerged as a hybrid machine learning paradigm that imbues ML models with physical domain knowledge such as thermomechanical laws and constraints. The distinguishing feature of PIML is the synergistic integration of data-driven methods that reflect system dynamics in real-time with the governing physics underlying AM. In this paper, the current state-of-the-art in metal AM is reviewed and opportunities for a paradigm shift to PIML are discussed, thereby identifying relevant future research directions.},

Here, we report the mechanisms of the melt flow instabilities in laser powder bed fusion additive manufacturing process revealed by in-situ high-speed high-resolution synchrotron X-ray imaging. We identified powder/droplet impact, significant keyhole oscillation, and melting-mode switching as three major mechanisms for causing melt flow instabilities. We demonstrated the detrimental consequences of these instabilities brought to the process, and projected new understanding on the melt flow evolution and keyhole oscillation.

However, the engineering applications of as-cast AlCoCrFeNi2.1 EHEAs still face challenges, such as coarse grain and low yield strength resulting from low solidification rate and temperature gradient. In this study, selective laser melting (SLM) was introduced into the preparation of AlCoCrFeNi2.1 EHEA to realize unique strength-ductility balance, with emphasis on investigating the effects of processing parameters on its eutectic microstructure and properties. The results show that the SLM-ed samples exhibit a completely eutectic structure consisting of ultra-fine face-centered cubic (FCC) and ordered body-centered cubic (B2) phases, and the duplex microstructure undergoes a morphological evolution from lamellar structure to cellular structure as laser energy input reducing. The SLM-ed AlCoCrFeNi2.1 EHEA presents an excellent match of high tensile strength (1271 MPa), yield strength (966 MPa), and good ductility (22.5\%) at room temperature, which are significantly enhanced by the ultra-fine grains and heterogeneous structure due to rapid solidification rate and high temperature gradient during SLM. Especially, the yield strength increment of {$\sim$}50\% is realized with no loss in ductility as compared with the as-cast samples with the same composition. On this basis, the precise complex component with excellent mechanical properties is well achieved. This work paves the way for the performance improvement and complex parts preparation of EHEA by microstructural design using laser additive manufacturing.},

Obvious enrichment of Zr in the Y4Al2O9 particles by substitution for the yttrium is observed, which effectively eliminates the segregation of Zr along the grain boundaries.

The powder beds have  unimodal or bimodal distributions without random effects in the particle composition. Their  density and thermal conductivity is adapted to reality.

Single-line scanning of a laser beam over a thin layer of metallic powder placed on a dense substrate of the same material is studied. Both the laser beam diameter and the layer thickness are about 50\hspace{0.6em}{$\mu$}m. The typical scanning velocity is in the range of 10\textendash 20 cm/s. An effective volumetric heat source is estimated from laser radiation scattering and absorption in a powder layer. A strong difference in thermal conductivity between the powder bed and dense material is taken into account. The above conditions correspond to the technology of selective laser melting that is applied to build objects of complicated shape from metallic powder. Complete remelting of the powder in the scanned zone and its good adhesion to the substrate ensure fabrication of functional parts with mechanical properties close to the ones of the wrought material. Experiments with single-line melting indicate that an interval of scanning velocities exists, where the remelted tracks are uniform. The tracks become ``broken'' if the scanning velocity is outside this interval. This is extremely undesirable and referred to as the ``balling'' effect. The size and the shape of the melt pool and the surface of the metallurgical contact of the remelted material to the substrate are analyzed in relation to the scanning velocity. The modeling results are compared with experimental observation of laser tracks. The experimentally found balling effect at scanning velocities above {$\sim$}20\hspace{0.6em}cm/s can be explained by the Plateau\textendash Rayleigh capillary instability of the melt pool. Two factors destabilize the process with increasing the scanning velocity: increasing the length-to-width ratio of the melt pool and decreasing the width of its contact with the substrate.},

The technological processes strongly depend on such effective radiative-transfer properties of powder beds as the absorptance and the radiation penetration depth. However, it is still not completely clear what are the principal factors influencing these properties and what are the possible ranges of their variation. For theoretical investigation of the radiative transfer, a ray-tracing method is developed where the effective properties of powder beds are expanded in series of the reflectance of the solid-phase surface. Once the coefficients of the power series are calculated, they can be used for any combination wavelength/material thus facilitating parametric analysis. Powder beds are modeled by equal spheres packed in regular cubic-symmetry structures of various density. The calculated radiation penetration depth can vary from few particle diameters for close-packed structures with moderate solid-phase absorptance to few tens of particle diameters for less dense power beds of a highly reflecting material. The effective absorptance of the powder bed is revealed to decrease significantly with the packing density. The calculated dependence of the powder-bed absorptance versus the solid-phase absorptance and the density is validated by the known experimental data. The calculated angular distribution of the radiation reflected by a powder bed slightly deviates from the cosine-like distribution corresponding to the diffuse reflection law. It is validated by the known experimental data. A modified model of equivalent medium is proposed to approximate the obtained ray tracing results by analytic expressions.},

  abstract = {Additive manufacturing (AM) assisted by a digital twin is expected to revolutionize the realization of high-value and high-complexity functional parts on a global scale. Machine learning (ML) introduced in digitized AM provides potential to transform AM data into knowledge continuously and automatically; hence AM products will be designed and manufactured with improved quality. Conventional product development systems, however, fail to fully adopt ML algorithms on the increasingly available AM data for knowledge acquisition. To address the limitation, this paper proposes an algorithmic framework for constructing AM knowledge automatically and continuously from data. The proposed algorithm develops predictive models to correlate process parameters with part structure and properties using ML algorithms on design, process control, in-situ monitoring, and ex-situ measurement AM data. Based on the predictive models, the algorithm constructs prescriptive rules necessary for decision-making in AM product developments. The constructed rule knowledge is stored in a knowledge base by the algorithm for further AM knowledge query and constructions. Then, the algorithm provides feedback to a knowledge-query formulation phase, which forms the algorithm into a closed loop. Through the algorithm, AM knowledge can self-evolve continuously, while reflecting dynamically generated AM data in an automated and autonomous manner. A case study is presented to illustrate the proposed algorithm and a software prototype is developed to demonstrate the algorithm capability.},

Crystallographic characterization confirmed that \{332\}{$\langle$}113{$\rangle$} and \{112\}{$\langle$}111{$\rangle$} twinning and shear stress assisted the {$\alpha$}-{$\omega$} and {$\beta\rightarrow\alpha$}" transitions at the interface of the {$\beta$} region. Both the {$\alpha$}ꞌꞌ martensitic twin and {$\omega$} formation were observed adjacent to the \{332\}{$\langle$}113{$\rangle$} type twinning mode. The [332] twinning were instigated and nucleated through {$\omega$}-phase formation. The secondary [112] twins amid the primary [332] twinning were instigated and nucleated through {$\omega$}-phase formation. Multiple slip bands were identified on the surface of the micropillar after the microcompression testing. Moreover, high-density dislocations and dislocation pile-ups were found alongside the twins and grain boundaries. In addition, \{112\}{$\langle$}111{$\rangle$} twinning was identified amongst dislocation pile-ups. This work reveals a novel complex phase transformation that could play a significant role in applications such as biomedical implants.},

Heat-treating the specimens reduced their UTS values, but they still exceeded the literature value by 8\%. Hardness measurements indicate that the Vickers hardness is approximately 10\% lower for the as-printed specimens when compared to the literature value for wrought AF9628, while it is at least 6\% greater for the heat-treated specimens than the wrought AF9628. Electron backscatter diffraction results showed that the as-printed microstructure exhibited features typical of the martensitic transformation in quench-and-temper steels.},

One of the unique characteristics of AM is that the texture can be varied as a function of position within the product by controlling the scan strategy. The transient behavior of the texture and the factor used to control it via the scan strategy are discussed. In addition, the texture evolution behavior of face- and body-centered cubic as well as noncubic materials is discussed. The importance of the crystallographic ``multiplicity'' of the preferential crystal growth direction is described to understand the evolution behavior of the texture in such materials.},

The effect of annealing on the microstructure, phase distribution and mechanical properties was systematically investigated by characterizing the as-built and the subsequently annealed alloys. The as-built MEA showed a microstructure of homogeneously distributed ordered B2 single-phase, and exhibited a great compressive yield strength of over 1850~MPa but relatively insufficient ductility of 13.8\%. After annealing, the microstructure transformed to a heterogeneous structure with Ni\textendash Al rich ordered B2 and Fe\textendash Ni\textendash Cr rich FCC phases, as well as a few Fe\textendash Cr rich BCC phase. With the increase of annealing temperature to 1050~\textdegree C, the ductility of the annealed MEAs significantly improved while the compressive yield strength decreased from 1185.85~MPa (as-built) to 614.93~MPa. Despite the certainly compromised yield strength, a good strength-ductility synergy and superior strain hardening capacity of the additively manufactured MEA were achieved via subsequent heat treatment. Furthermore, the underlying mechanisms of the decreased yield strength under high annealing temperature and the superior strain hardening capacity of the annealed alloy were analyzed. The findings of this work show the feasibility of achieving the required strength-ductility synergy of additively manufactured HEAs/MEAs by tailoring microstructural heterogeneity using subsequent heat treatment.},

To this end, the PDEs are reformulated using backward stochastic differential equations and the gradient of the unknown solution is approximated by neural networks, very much in the spirit of deep reinforcement learning with the gradient acting as the policy function. Numerical results on examples including the nonlinear Black\textendash Scholes equation, the Hamilton\textendash Jacobi\textendash Bellman equation, and the Allen\textendash Cahn equation suggest that the proposed algorithm is quite effective in high dimensions, in terms of both accuracy and cost.

Especially for safety-critical applications, a quality assurance of the components is indispensable. However, time-consuming and costly quality assurance measures, such as computer tomography, represent a barrier for further industrial spreading. For this reason, alternative methods for process anomaly detection using process monitoring systems have been developed. However, the defect detection quality of current methods is limited, as single monitoring systems only detect specific process anomalies. Therefore, a new methodology to evaluate the data of multiple monitoring systems is derived using sensor data fusion. Focus was placed on the causes and the appearance of defects in different monitoring systems (photodiodes, on- and off-axis high-speed cameras, and thermography). Based on this, indicators representing characteristics of the process were developed to reduce the data. Finally, deterministic models for the data fusion within a monitoring system and between the monitoring systems were developed. The result was a defect detection of up to 92\% of the melt track defects. The methodology was thus able to determine process anomalies and to evaluate the suitability of a specific process monitoring system for the defect detection.},

Additive manufacturing, especially laser powder bed fusion (LPBF), of Haynes 282 is being researched for its potential applications in aerospace and power generation sectors. LPBF enables us to achieve desired properties via microstructure control through process parameter optimization. Integrated computational materials engineering (ICME) approach can be used to tune the process parameters to obtain desired microstructure, instead of trial-and-error methods. In this report, ICME framework has been established to simulate microstructural evolution during LPBF and post-processing of Haynes 282. A dimensionless number was used to optimize the process parameters with minimal porosity. Thermal modelling was performed using a semi-analytical model and the obtained thermal data was used to simulate solidification during LPBF. The corresponding cell spacing obtained matched closely with the experimental data. The segregation pattern extracted from the phase-field model was used as input for homogenization simulation. The {$\gamma{'}$} precipitate evolution was predicted using Langer\textendash Schwartz theory and Kampmann\textendash Wagner-Numerical (KWN) approach. The predicted values agreed with the experimentally measured values. The room temperature yield strength of as-built samples was comparable and that of heat-treated samples were superior to the aged wrought material.},

  abstract = {In the current review, an exceptional view on the multi-scale integrated computational modelling and data-driven methods in the Additive manufacturing (AM) of metallic materials in the framework of integrated computational materials engineering (ICME) is discussed. In the first part of the review, process simulation (P-S linkage), structure modelling (S-P linkage), property simulation (S-P linkage), and integrated modelling (PSP and PSPP linkages) are elaborated considering different physical phenomena (multi-physics) in AM and at micro/meso/macro scales (multi-scale modelling). The second part provides an extensive discussion of a data-driven framework, which involves extracting existing data from databases and texts, data pre-processing, high throughput screening, and, therefore, database construction. A data-driven workflow that integrates statistical methods, including ML, artificial intelligence (AI), and neural network (NN) models, has great potential for completing PSPP linkages. This review paper provides an insight for both academic and industrial researchers, working on the AM of metallic materials.},

  abstract = {This study focuses on the processability of four low-alloy steels (AISI 4130, 4140, 4340 and 8620) via laser-based powder bed fusion (LB-PBF). In the as-built condition, the alloys consisted of tempered martensite that was the result of an intrinsic heat treatment (IHT) during LB-PBF. In terms of defects, a distinct transition in porosity was observed that correlated to the volumetric energy density (VED). At low VED, specimens contained a lack of fusion porosity, while at high VED, they contained keyhole porosity. Additionally, cold cracking was observed in 4140 and 4340 specimens produced at low/intermediate VEDs. This cracking could be mitigated by increasing the VED or laser power, as both enhance the IHT. This enhanced IHT lowered the material hardness below specific thresholds ({$<$}500HV 4340 and {$<$}460 4140), increasing ductility and allowing the specimens to avoid cracking. From these findings, crack-free, high-density ({$>$}99.8\%) low-alloy steel specimens were produced without the requirement of build plate preheating.},

The MBE 2020 witnessed another year-over-year registration and attendance growth. The MBE Summit saw hundreds of attendees gather over three days to share their experiences with Model-Based Enterprise (MBE). This speaks to the continued growing interest of MBE within the community and the importance of the Summit output. The goal of the MBE Summit is to identify challenges, research, implementation issues, and lessons learned in design, manufacturing, quality assurance, and sustainment of products and processes where a digital three-dimensional (3D) model of the product serves as the authoritative information source for all activities in a product's lifecycle. The theme of MBE 2020 was "Increasing MBE Adoption and Implementation." There is no doubt that MBE requires a complex organizational work design that recognizes the interaction between people, skills, and technology in workplaces. The 11th MBE Summit is focused on highlighting the organizational culture surrounding MBE, needs of people operating in MBE, and real-world implementations of MBE in practice. Authors from academia, government, and industry submitted papers on topics related to this year's theme using the following tracks: 1) Business Processes; 2) Organization Culture; 3) Technology; and 4) Workforce Skills. This volume contains the papers presented at MBE 2020. The MBE 2020 program included four invited talks, five tutorials, five panels, and 25 papers. In addition, the MBE 2020 program included a vendor-demonstration track where solution providers and vendors demonstrated MBE offerings.},

  abstract = {A high strength Al-5024 alloy containing Sc and Zr with a bi-modal microstructure consisting of fine equiaxed and coarse columnar grains was successfully fabricated by laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) additive manufacturing. The formation of the bi-modal microstructure was mainly due to both the formation of primary Al3Sc precipitates that act as nucleation sites and the steep temperature gradient during LPBF. By simulating the thermal field of a single melt pool, the formation mechanism of the bi-modal microstructure was explained. It was found by simulation that a solidification interface velocity less than 110 mm/s was beneficial to the nucleation of Al3Sc precipitates and, hence, facilitated the formation of a fine grain microstructure. Applying different heat treatments revealed a trade-off trend between yield strength and ductility as a function of the heat treatment time, and a correlation in fatigue life and yield strength were observed, both of which were closely related to the status of the secondary Al3Sc precipitates. The highest ultimate tensile strength of 450 MPa and corresponding 107 cycle fatigue strength of 105 MPa were achieved after hot isostatic pressing for 4 h at 325\textdegree C with 100 MPa pressure. Dynamic strain aging was found to occur in both as-built and some heat treated samples, which was related to magnesium (Mg) solute atom clustering attributed to: (i) the formation of a diffuse ``Mg wall'' due to the repetitive melting and rapid cooling in LPBF, and (ii) the growth of intragranular (Al3Sc) and intergranular precipitates (Fe-, Mn-rich) during subsequent heat treatment, thereby leading to an increasing number of misfit dislocations that promote the formation of Mg atom clusters},

Four bridge artifacts (75 mm long, 5 mm wide, 12.5 mm tall) are created in each of three builds using a commercial laser powder bed fusion system. The builds are performed using nickel super alloy 625 (IN625). High-speed infrared thermography performed during four of the builds is used to measure the melt-pool length and cooling rate within a select region. The temperature of the substrate and build volume is measured during the fifth build to provide data to establish the boundary conditions for thermal models.}

This dataset and the associated experiments are part of a continuing series of controlled benchmark tests, in conjunction with a conference series, with two initial goals, 1) to allow modelers of Additive Manufacturing processes to test their simulations against rigorous, highly controlled additive manufacturing benchmark test data, and 2) to encourage additive manufacturing practitioners to develop novel mitigation strategies for challenging build scenarios. More information regarding the AMBench 2018 study can be found at www.nist.gov/ambench. For this year's challenge, multiple laser scan tracks were performed on bare nickel-based superalloy IN625 substrates using three different combinations of laser power and scan speed. A high-speed infrared camera was used to measure the infrared emissions during each scan track, allowing measurement of the melt pool length and cooling rate of the solidified material. Details related to this dataset are provided in the associated NIST Journal of Research article (in press). Post-process characterization of these scan-tracks was also performed.

Compared to traditional numerical solvers, SimNet addresses a wide range of use cases - coupled forward simulations without any training data, inverse and data assimilation problems. SimNet offers fast turnaround time by enabling parameterized system representation that solves for multiple configurations simultaneously, as opposed to the traditional solvers that solve for one configuration at a time. SimNet is integrated with parameterized constructive solid geometry as well as STL modules to generate point clouds. Furthermore, it is customizable with APIs that enable user extensions to geometry, physics and network architecture. It has advanced network architectures that are optimized for high-performance GPU computing, and offers scalable performance for multi-GPU and multi-Node implementation with accelerated linear algebra as well as FP32, FP64 and TF32 computations. In this paper we review the neural network solver methodology, the SimNet architecture, and the various features that are needed for effective solution of the PDEs. We present real-world use cases that range from challenging forward multi-physics simulations with turbulence and complex 3D geometries, to industrial design optimization and inverse problems that are not addressed efficiently by the traditional solvers. Extensive comparisons of SimNet results with open source and commercial solvers show good correlation.},

  abstract = {Additive manufacturing (AM) is gaining popularity because of its ability to manufacture complex parts in less time. Despite recent research involving designs of experiments (DOEs) to characterize the relationships between some AM process parameters and various part quality characteristics, to date, there seems to be no universally accepted comprehensive model that relates process parameters to part quality. In this paper, to support the goal of manufacturing parts right the first time, a Bayesian network in continuous domain is developed which relates four process parameters (laser power, scan speed, hatch spacing, and layer thickness) and five part quality characteristics (density, hardness, top layer surface roughness, ultimate tensile strength in the build direction and ultimate tensile strength perpendicular to the build direction). A machine learning algorithm is used to train the network on a database mined from a large number of publications with experimental data from parts built using 316L with selective laser melting. Using this Bayesian network, the user is able to enter a value for one or more known nodes or variables, and the network provides predictions on all the remaining nodes in the form of probability distributions. A method is developed whereby the user inputs are checked for reasonableness using an n -dimensional convex hull, and if necessary a recommendation is returned based on user-defined weights. The network is validated by retaining a subset of the training data for testing and comparing the network's predictions to the known values. Accuracy is optimized by continually re-training the network using parts built with a specific machine of interest. The industrial relevance of this research is outlined with respect to four current challenges in AM, including the length of time to determine optimal process parameters for a new machine, ability to organize relevant knowledge, quantification of machine variability, and transfer of knowledge to new operators.},

  abstract = {The influence of various laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) process parameters on the crystallographic textures and mechanical properties of a typical Ni-based solid-solution strengthened alloy, Hastelloy-X, was examined. Samples were classified into four groups based on the type of crystallographic texture: single crystalline-like microstructure with \&lt;100\&gt;//build direction (BD) (\&lt;100\&gt;-SCM), single crystalline-like microstructure with \&lt;110\&gt;//BD (\&lt;110\&gt;-SCM), crystallographic lamellar microstructure (CLM), or polycrystalline microstructure (PCM). These four crystallographic textures were realized in Hastelloy-X for the first time here to the best of our knowledge. The mechanical properties of the samples varied depending on their texture. The tensile properties were affected not only by the Schmid factor but also by the grain size and the presence of lamellar boundaries (grain boundaries). The lamellar boundaries at the interface between the \&lt;110\&gt;//BD oriented main layers and the \&lt;100\&gt;//BD-oriented sub-layers of CLM contributed to the resistance to slip transmission and the increased proof stress. It was possible to control a wide range of crystallographic microstructures via the LPBF process parameters, which determines the melt pool morphology and solidification behavior.},

  abstract = {Summation-by-parts (SBP) finite-difference discretizations share many attractive properties with Galerkin finite-element methods (FEMs), including time stability and superconvergent functionals; however, unlike FEMs, SBP operators are not completely determined by a basis, so the potential exists to tailor SBP operators to meet different objectives. To date, application of highorder SBP discretizations to multiple dimensions has been limited to tensor product domains. This paper presents a definition for multi-dimensional SBP finite-difference operators that is a natural extension of one-dimensional SBP operators. Theoretical implications of the definition are investigated for the special case of a diagonal norm (mass) matrix. In particular, a diagonal-norm SBP operator exists on a given domain if and only if there is a cubature rule with positive weights on that domain and the polynomial-basis matrix has full rank when evaluated at the cubature nodes. Appropriate simultaneous-approximation terms are developed to impose boundary conditions weakly, and the resulting discretizations are shown to be time stable. Concrete examples of multi-dimensional SBP operators are constructed for the triangle and tetrahedron; similarities and differences with spectralelement and spectral-difference methods are discussed. An assembly process is described that builds diagonal-norm SBP operators on a global domain from element-level operators. Numerical results of linear advection on a doubly periodic domain demonstrate the accuracy and time stability of the simplex operators.},

However, pores formed during the printing process impair the mechanical performance of the printed parts, severely hindering their widespread application. Here, we report six pore formation mechanisms that were observed during the LPBF process. Our results reconfirm three pore formation mechanisms - keyhole induced pores, pore formation from feedstock powder and pore formation along the melting boundary during laser melting from vaporization of a volatile substance or an expansion of a tiny trapped gas. We also observe three new pore formation mechanisms: (1) pore trapped by surface fluctuation, (2) pore formation due to depression zone fluctuation when the depression zone is shallow and (3) pore formation from a crack. The results presented here provide direct evidence and insight into pore formation mechanisms during the LPBF process, which may guide the development of pore elimination/mitigation approaches. Since certain laser processing conditions studied here are similar to the situations in high energy density laser welding, the results presented here also have implications for laser welding.}

Here, by combining in-situ high-speed high-resolution synchrotron x-ray imaging experiments and multi-physics modeling, we unveil the dynamics and mechanisms of pore motion and elimination in the LPBF process. We find that the high thermocapillary force, induced by the high temperature gradient in the laser interaction region, can rapidly eliminate pores from the melt pool during the LPBF process. The thermocapillary force driven pore elimination mechanism revealed here may guide the development of 3D printing approaches to achieve pore-free 3D printing of metals.},

The melt pool geometry, cooling rates, and dendritic microstructure of the single laser scan tracks on bare Inconel 625 plates are predicted by three types of computational models, namely the high fidelity welding model, fluid model, and conduction model for two cases without and with the formation of keyholes. The molten pool geometry in terms of its depth, width, and length as well as the cooling rates at the surface is used for comparing simulated results of various approaches against the NIST experimental results from the two testbeds, which are referred to as the additive manufacturing metrology test bed and commercial build machine (CBM) cases. A comparison of the spatial distribution of cooling rates is also presented to illustrate the importance of using a high fidelity welding model. The thermal gradient and the growth rate of the solid-to-liquid interface are used to predict the primary dendrite arm spacing. It is identified that the high fidelity welding model played a pivotal role in achieving accurate predictions of the CBM cases. The CBM cases with a higher laser energy density resulted in keyhole formation, which led to a high aspect ratio of the molten pool shape. Neglecting the keyhole model leads to large under-predictions of the molten pool depth. Additionally, the correct primary dendrite arm spacing prediction of the CBM cases is only possible with the keyhole model.},

The localised and rapid heating and cooling in the process presents a challenge for the experimental methods used to measure temperature. As a result, understanding of these process fundamentals is limited. In this paper a method is developed that uses coaxial imaging with high-speed cameras to give both the spatial and temporal resolution necessary to resolve the surface temperature of the melt pool. A two wavelength imaging setup is used to account for changes in emissivity. Temperature fields are captured at 100\,kHz with a resolution of 20\,{$\mu$}m during the processing of a simple Ti6Al4V component. Thermal gradients in the range 5\textendash 20\,K/{$\mu$}m and cooling rates in range 1\textendash 40\,K/{$\mu$}s are measured. The results presented give new insight into the effect of parameters, geometry and scan path on the melt pool temperature and cooling rates. The method developed here provides a new tool to assist in optimising scan strategies and parameters, identifying the causes of defect prone locations and controlling cooling rates for local microstructure development.},

The acoustic emission (AE) approach has gained a reputation in non-destructive testing (NDT) as one of the most influential and proven techniques in numerous engineering fields. Material testing through AE has become one of the most popular techniques in AM because of its capability to detect defects and anomalies, monitoring, and the progress of flaws. Various AE techniques have been under investigation for in-situ monitoring of AM. The preliminary results from AE exploration show promising results that need further investigation on data analysis and signal processing. AE monitoring technique allows finding the defects during the fabrication process so that the AM failure can be prevented or the process can be finely tuned to avoid damages or material waste. In this work, AE data recorded over the Direct Energy Deposition (DED) additive manufacturing process analyzed by machine learning (ML) algorithm for classification of different build conditions. The feature extraction method is used to obtain the required data for further processing. Wavelet transformation of signals has been used to acquire the time-frequency spectrum of the AE signals at each process condition, and convolutional neural network (CNN) image processing is used to identify the transformed spectrum of different build conditions. The identifiers in AE signals are correlated to the part quality by statistical methods. The results show a promising approach for quality evaluation and process monitoring in AM.},

A small hatch spacing - fast scanning strategy was utilized for obtaining parts with minimum porosity and unmelted Nb particle combination. The mesostructure of the fabricated blocks comprises columnar grains with alternating Nb-poor regions (NPRs), which occur due to the short residence time of materials in the melt that limits the melting and diffusion of Nb, and matrix layers. Extensive {$\omega$}iso precipitates were noted in the microstructure, which were attributed to the large-build related heat accumulation during the LB-PBF process that stems from the combination of large sample size and high energy density input. Consequently, ductility of the as-built parts was low. The FCG rate at high {$\increment$}K was strongly influenced by the layers of NPR and hence depend on the orientation whereas the near-threshold FCG rate was strongly influenced by the local slip systems ahead of the crack tip. Significant anisotropy in KIC, a result of the crack deflection by the NPR/matrix interfaces, was observed. The mesostructure induced toughening mechanism improves the fracture toughness of the resultant alloy despite its brittle failure response. The potential of in-situ alloying to induce toughening through the mesostructure control was discussed.},

  abstract = {This work presents a methodology for predicting a hybrid microstructure and defect processing map for laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) additive manufacturing (AM). A finite element (FE) analysis based thermal model is coupled with a phase field model (PFM) in order to predict both defect formation and microstructure across the LPBF process parameter space. The parameter space is first categorized into defect regions such as keyholing, balling, and lack of fusion. These regions are predicted using the FE thermal model, allowing a defect map to be generated based on the geometries of the melt pools for a defined powder layer thickness. A region of the parameter space that leads to successful AM of defect-free parts is then identified. Segregation across the parameter space is predicted by an integrated computational model, which couples a finite interface dissipation PFM and the aforementioned FE thermal model. The parameter space is then separated into regions that result in cellular or planar microstructures based on the area fraction of cellular-dendritic segregation predicted within the melt pools. By merging the microstructure and defect maps, a hybrid microstructure-defect printability map is generated that distinguishes a process parameter region for fabricating defect-free parts with homogeneous microstructures. This hybrid map is validated with experimental observations for a Ni-5wt.\%Nb alloy. The hybrid printability map can be used in the rapid selection and optimization of process parameters for additively manufacturing any alloy (provided models and their parameterization are available, and the alloy is printable), and can potentially help design alloys best suited for AM.},

  abstract = {In order to predict the more accurate shape information of the melt pool in Selective Laser Melting (SLM), a new finite element temperature field simulations model is proposed. The simulations use a new heat source model that takes into account the influence of the powder layout, the surface of the substrate and the changes in the thickness of the powder layer after fusion on the energy distribution. In order to construct this new heat source model, firstly an improved optimization method based on the gradient descent and the univariate search technique is proposed to simulate the powder layout, and then the laser beam propagation between the powder and the surface of the substrate is tracked and recorded to obtain the energy distribution. Finally, according to the distribution of laser energy between the powder layer and the surface of the substrate, the heat source model is divided into two parts: one is the surface of substrate heat source model being the Gaussian distribution, the other one is the powder layer heat source model-satisfying the Gaussian distribution on the horizontal plane, changes in the depth direction according to the functional relationship obtained by the fitting. In addition, the thickness change of the powder layer after fusion is analyzed, and is taken into account in the heat source model. The powder simulation results are compared with the powder scattering experiment results to verify the effectiveness of the powder model. Comparing the temperature field simulation with the experiment, the results show that the predicted molten pool width relative error is 6.4\%, and the connect width error is 9.6\%, which has better accuracy and verifies the validity of the temperature field simulation model.},

In this work, a novel grain refiner consisting of submicron TiH2 and amorphous B particles was developed to control such features in SLM-fabricated AA7075 alloy. Crack-free and dense (TiH2+B)/AA7075 alloy was fabricated under optimal SLM processing. Results show that the addition of TiH2 and B particles can convert coarse columnar grains into homogeneous equiaxed grains, decrease the average grain size from 29.1\,{$\mu$}m to 2.3\,{$\mu$}m, and consequently eliminate the hot-cracking in (TiH2+B)/AA7075 alloy. The remarkable grain refinement is mainly attributed to heterogeneous nucleation promoted by a combination of in-situ formed L12-Al3Ti and TiB2 nanoparticles. After T6 heat treatment, the (TiH2+B)/AA7075 alloy behaves superior mechanical properties(tensile strength of {$\sim$}582~MPa and ductility of {$\sim$}12.8\%) to most previously reported SLM-fabricated 7075 alloys. Synergetic effects of crack elimination, grain refinement, and precipitation strengthening are responsible for the excellent mechanical properties.},

  abstract = {High entropy or multi principal element alloys are a promising and relatively young concept for designing alloys. The idea of creating alloys without a single main alloying element opens up a wide space for possible new alloy compositions. High entropy alloys based on refractory metals such as W, Mo, Ta or Nb are of interest for future high temperature applications e.g., in the aerospace or chemical industry. However, producing refractory metal high entropy alloys by conventional metallurgical methods remains challenging. For this reason, the feasibility of laser-based additive manufacturing of the refractory metal high entropy alloy W20Mo20Ta20Nb20V20 by laser powder bed fusion (PBF-LB/M) is investigated in the present work. In-situ alloy formation from mixtures of easily available elemental powders is employed to avoid an expensive atomization of pre-alloyed powder. It is shown that PBF-LB/M of W20Mo20Ta20Nb20V20 is in general possible and that a complete fusion of the powder mixture without a significant number of undissolved particles is achievable by in-situ alloy formation during PBF-LB/M when selecting favorable process parameter combinations. The relative density of the samples with a dimension of 6 \texttimes{} 6 \texttimes{} 6 mm3 reaches, in dependence of the PBF-LB/M parameter set, 99.8\%. Electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) measurements confirm the presence of a single bcc-phase. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images show a dendritic and/or cellular microstructure that can, to some extent, be controlled by the PBF-LB/M parameters.},

  abstract = {In-situ alloy formation by Laser Powder Bed Fusion (PBF-LB/M) from mixtures of easily available elemental powders is an appealing approach for developing and qualifying new alloys for laser based additive manufacturing of metals. However, especially when dealing with high-melting elements, like W, Ta, Mo, or Nb, it is difficult to achieve a homogeneous element distribution and a complete fusion of the powder particles. The aim of this work was to understand the effects of the PBF-LB/M process parameters (laser power, scan speed, laser spot diameter) and three different single- and double-exposure strategies on the fusion of high-melting W, Ta, Mo, and Nb particles in a Ti-matrix. For this purpose, 220 samples with 10 vol.\% of the high-melting particle fraction were prepared and analyzed by optical light microscopy and automated image processing, as well as by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The results are discussed in the context of current research on the process dynamics of PBF-LB/M. Based on that process strategies to support a complete fusion of high-melting particles during in-situ alloy formation are derived. It is shown that the number of unmolten particles can be at least decreased by a factor of ten compared to the most unfavorable parameter combination. For the lower melting elements, Nb and Mo, a complete fusion without any remaining particles visible in the microsections was achieved for certain parameter combinations. The results prove the feasibility of in-situ alloy formation with high-melting alloying elements, but they also demonstrate the necessity to adjust the PBF-LB/M process strategy to achieve a complete dissolution of the alloying elements.},

Large-scale adaptation of these technologies is hampered due to the presence of defects such as porosity and part distortion. Nonuniform melt pool size is a major cause of these defects. The melt pool size changes due to heat from the previous powder bed tracks. In this work, the effect of heat sourced from neighbouring tracks was modelled and feedback control was designed. The objective of control is to regulate the melt pool cross-sectional area rejecting the effect of heat from neighbouring tracks within a layer of the powder bed. The SLM process's thermal model was developed using the energy balance of lumped melt pool volume. The disturbing heat from neighbouring tracks was modelled as the initial temperature of the melt pool. Combining the thermal model with disturbance model resulted in a nonlinear model describing melt pool evolution. The PID, a classical feedback control approach, was used to minimize the effect of intertrack disturbance on the melt pool area. The controller was tuned for the desired melt pool area in a known environment. Simulation results revealed that the proposed controller regulated the desired melt pool area during the scan of multiple tracks of a powder layer within 16 milliseconds and within a length of 0.04 mm reducing laser power by 10\% approximately in five tracks. This reduced the chance of pore formation. Hence, it enhances the quality of components manufactured using the SLM process, reducing defects.},

Through the calculation of phase diagrams (CALPHAD) and a method based on Scheil solidification, the Al-8wt.\%Ce-10wt.\%Mg alloy was evaluated for LPBF to be microstructurally favorable to yield components with full volumetric density, without the need for post-processing. Through an exhaustive LPBF parametric study, documentation of defects was performed for the use of a wide range of laser power and scan speed combinations, i.e., varying the energy density, followed by microstructural characterization with X-ray diffraction, optical and electron microscopy, and mechanical testing with both Vickers hardness and quasi-static uniaxial tension. Overall, defects were observed with use of high and low laser powers and scan speeds, but a processing window for LPBF was observed at both high and low laser powers, where {$>$}99\% volumetric density was achieved. Besides defects, decreasing the scan speed, i.e., increasing the energy density, resulted in decreases in the concentration of Mg, down to a maximum of 4.5wt.\% due to vaporization. Moreover, a decrease in Mg led to a lower Vickers hardness, attributed to a decrease in the solid solutioning of Mg in the {$\alpha$}-Al matrix. Samples selected for tensile mechanical testing were produced with a LPBF laser power of 200W traversing at 800mm/s, which yielded a density {$>$} 99\% and Mg concentration of approximately 7wt.\%. A yield strength and ultimate tensile strength of 377 and 468MPa, respectively, was found for those produced with the power of 200W. However, the ductility of the alloy was less than 2\% elongation at failure. A fine ({$<$} 1 {$\mu$}m) sub-grain cellular solidification structure was found distributed throughout the {$\alpha$}-Al matrix, with ribbons of the eutectic Al11Ce3 intermetallic distributed along the intercellular boundaries. The high strengths achieved in this alloy were attributed to contribution from Orowan dislocation looping of the Al11Ce3 phase, the high degree of solid solutioning of Mg in the {$\alpha$}-Al matrix, and cellular boundary strengthening due to impeding dislocation movement.},

  abstract = {Additive manufacturing (AM) is a new paradigm in design-driven build of customized products. Nonetheless, mass customization and low volume production make the AM quality assurance extremely challenging. Advanced imaging provides an unprecedented opportunity to increase information visibility, cope with the product complexity, and enable on-the-fly quality control in AM. However, in-situ images of a customized AM build show a high level of layer-to-layer geometry variation, which hampers the use of powerful image-based learning methods such as deep neural networks (DNNs) for flaw detection. Few, if any, previous works investigated how to tackle the impact of AM customization on image-guided process monitoring and control. The proposed research is aimed at filling this gap by developing a novel real-time and multi-scale process monitoring methodology for quality control of customized AM builds. Specifically, we leverage the computer-aided design (CAD) file to perform shape-to-image registration and delineate the regions of interests in lay-erwise images. Next, a hierarchical dyadic partitioning methodology is developed to split layer-to-layer regions of interest into subregions with the same number of pixels to provide freeform geometry analysis. Then, we propose a semiparametric model to characterize the complex spatial patterns in each customized subregion and boost the computational speed. Finally, a DNN model is designed to learn and detect fine-grained information of flaws. Experimental results show that the proposed process monitoring and control methodology detects flaws in each layer with an accuracy of 92.50{$\pm$}1.03\%. This provides an opportunity to reduce inter-layer variation in AM prior to completion of the build. The proposed methodology can also be generally applicable in a variety of engineering and medical domains that entail image-based process monitoring and control with customized designs.},

  abstract = {The goal of this work is to understand the effect of process conditions on lack of fusion porosity in parts made using laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) additive manufacturing (AM) process, and subsequently, to detect the onset of process conditions that lead to lack of fusion-related porosity from in-process sensor data. In pursuit of this goal, the objectives of this work are twofold: (1) quantify the count (number), size and location of pores as a function of three LPBF process parameters, namely, the hatch spacing (H), laser velocity (V), and laser power (P); and (2) monitor and identify process conditions that are liable to cause porosity through analysis of in-process layer-by-layer optical images of the build invoking multifractal and spectral graph theoretic features. These objectives are important because porosity has a significant impact on the functional integrity of LPBF parts, such as fatigue life. Furthermore, linking process conditions to defects via sensor signatures is the first step toward in-process quality assurance in LPBF. To achieve the first objective, titanium alloy (Ti\textendash 6Al\textendash 4V) test cylinders of 10\,mm diameter\,\texttimes\,25\,mm height were built under differing H, V, and P settings on a commercial LPBF machine (EOS M280). The effect of these process parameters on count, size, and location of pores was quantified based on X-ray computed tomography (XCT) images. To achieve the second objective, layerwise optical images of the powder bed were acquired as the parts were being built. Spectral graph theoretic and multifractal features were extracted from the layer-by-layer images for each test part. Subsequently, these features were linked to the process parameters using machine learning approaches. Through these image-based features, process conditions under which the parts were built were identified with the statistical fidelity over 80\% (F-score).},

  abstract = {Laser Powder-Bed Fusions (LPBF), a class of additive manufacturing (AM), is a promising technique for producing components with complex geometry design. However, parts fabricated by LPBF suffer from residual stresses arising due to substantial temperature gradients inherent to the process. Numerical models are unable to provide a comprehensive thermal history of the built materials efficiently due to the mismatch between the characteristic length scales and infinitesimal time steps needed for complete simulations. In the present work, an extended Rosenthal's model is presented by considering the effects of various heat dissipation/consumption mechanisms. The modeling results of energy auditing of thermal boundary conditions for stainless steel (SS17-4PH) laser melting indicated that the total energy losses by convection, radiation, and melting are less than 20\% among which, radiation is the most dominant part. A comparison of the results obtained by the extended Rosenthal's equation with finite element numerical predictions and experimental data shows a good agreement. Also, a parametric study has been conducted to identify the influence of laser scanning velocity, beam radius, and power on the overall temperature distributions and melt geometry. The present study can pave the way for the prospective use of this methodology to conduct further investigation such as microstructure analysis and thermomechanical modeling which are needed to predict residual stresses and distortions.},

  abstract = {In metal additive manufacturing, crystallographic orientation control is a promising method for tailoring the functions of metallic parts. However, despite its importance in the fabrication of texture-controlled functional parts, the stability of the crystallographic texture is not widely discussed. Herein, the crystallographic texture stability under laser powder bed fusion was investigated. Two methodologies were employed. One is that a laser scanning strategy was alternately changed for a specific number of layers. The other is a ``seeding'' experiment in which single-crystalline substrates with controlled crystallographic orientations in the building (z-) direction and the xy-plane (perpendicular to the building direction) were used as the starting substrate. The transient zone width, where the crystallographic orientation was inherited from the layer beneath, was analyzed to evaluate the texture stability. The crystallographic direction of the seed within the xy-plane, rather than the building direction, determined the transient zone width, i.e., the texture stability. In particular, the texture in the newly deposited portion was stable when the laser scanning direction matched the {$<$}100{$>$} orientation in the underneath layer, otherwise the crystal orientation switched rapidly, such that the {$<$}100{$>$} orientation was parallel to the scanning direction. Interestingly, the crystallographic orientation along the building direction in the underneath layer hardly impacted the stability of the texture. Therefore, for the first time, it has been clarified that the {$<$}100{$>$} orientation in the scanning direction, rather than the building direction, was preferentially stabilized, whereas the orientation in the other directions secondary stabilized.},

The technology has advanced vastly in the recent years and current systems can be used to manufacture functional parts for e.g. aerospace industry. The performance and accuracy of the systems have improved also, but certain difficulties in the powder fusion process are reducing the final quality of the parts. One of these is commonly known as the balling phenomenon. The aim of this study was to define some of the process characteristics in powder bed fusion by performing comparative studies with two different test setups. This was done by comparing measured temperature profiles and on-line photography of the process. The material used during the research was EOS PH1 stainless steel. Both of the test systems were equipped with 200W single mode fiber lasers. The main result of the research was that some of the process instabilities are resulting from the energy input during the process.},

  abstract = {The additive manufacturing (AM) of metals is becoming an increasingly important production process with the potential to replace traditional techniques such as casting. Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF) is used in many applications to print metal parts from powder. The metal powder is heated locally with sufficient laser radiation that the liquid melt easily reaches its boiling temperature, which leads to a metallic vapour jet that can entrain both powder bed particles and molten droplets. The small size of laser-matter interaction site makes a detailed experimental analysis of the process challenging. Synchrotron X-ray imaging experiments are one of the few methods which can capture the dynamic melting and solidification processes. Comparing such experiments with computer simulations of the process is an important approach in order to better understand the manufacturing process and to analyse the influence of process parameters on the evaporated gas jet and the acceleration of particles, which can lead to a deteriorated AM component quality. The melting and solidification of the metal powder is simulated using an Eulerian multiphase approach based on a control volume discretization of powder bed and substrate and a volume of liquid separation from melt and gas phase. The gas phase modelled as an ideal gas reaches velocities up to 100m/s. Lagrangian particle tracking in the simulation demonstrates that the velocity fields calculated by the Eulerian multi-phase approach in combination with a standard drag-force model lead to particle accelerations in good agreement with those measured experimentally. In order to avoid numerical laborious Lagrangian calculations, a direct method to compare an Eulerian multiphase simulation with synchrotron X-ray experiments was introduced and validated. This approach is used to analyse the influence of process parameters including laser power and laser speed on the maximal acceleration of particles from the melt pool area. While the particle acceleration increases linearly with line energy in the conduction mode, a linear decrease of the acceleration with increasing line energy can be found in the transition mode before the acceleration increases again with line energy in the keyhole mode.},

Today, trial-and-error methods are used to generate material property data under controlled conditions that may not map to the entire range of geometries over a part. Described here is the development of a modeling tool enabling prediction of the performance of parts built with AM, with rigorous consideration of the microstructural properties governing the nucleation and propagation of fatigue cracks. This tool, called DigitalClone\textregistered{} for Additive Manufacturing (DC-AM), is an Integrated Computational Materials Engineering (ICME) tool that includes models of crack initiation and damage progression with the high-fidelity process and microstructure modeling approaches. The predictive model has three main modules: process modeling, microstructure modeling, and fatigue modeling. In this paper, a detailed description and theoretical basis of each module is provided. Experimental validations (microstructure, porosity, and fatigue) of the tool using multiple material characterization and experimental coupon testing for five different AM materials are discussed. The physics-based computational modeling encompassed within DC-AM provides an efficient capability to more fully explore the design space across geometries and materials, leading to components that represent the optimal combination of performance, reliability, and durability.},

  abstract = {In our study, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) have been conducted on equimolar FeNiCr medium entropy alloy (MEA) powders. With the development of newer LPBF technologies capable of printing at the microscale, an even deeper understanding of the underlying atomistic effects of the process parameters on the microstructural and mechanical properties of the manufactured FeNiCr MEA products is required. In accordance with previous literature, the parameters of the LPBF process have been systematically varied, including layer resolution from 1 to 6, laser power from 100 \textmu W to 220 \textmu W, bed temperature from 300 K to 1200 K, and laser scan speed from 0.5 \AA/ps to 0.0625 \AA/ps. Consistent with prior macroscopic experimental findings, the atomistic results suggest that additive manufacturing using thinner layers imparts higher ultimate tensile strength (UTS) than fabricating with thicker layers. The latter, however, requires a shorter process time but induces keyhole defect formation if the laser-induced temperature is not sufficiently high enough. Increasing the temperature proves useful in mitigating this problem. Enhancement of UTS for the multi-rowed powders has been observed by raising the substrate temperature to 600 K or laser power to 160 \textmu W during production. Beyond these critical limits, however, the UTS of the product diminishes due to the emergence of multiple vacancies. The results of our present study will help researchers to find a good balance between the production speed and strength of additive manufactured products at the nanoscale.},

Fabricated samples underwent supplementary annealing treatment at 300 \textdegree C for 15 and 120min, eventually. During the thermal treatment, the fish-scale grains created after printing inside the melt pools after printing vanished gradually. In the as-built sample, molten Ni particles settled as big chunks of Al3Ni in the center and a thin strip of tiny Ni-rich masses in the borders of the melt pools. FIB/SEM and AFM images revealed that after 15min annealing, silicon cellular dendrites fragment into fine Si particles, and during annealing for 120min, the aluminium matrix expels out the supersaturated solute silicon atoms. Consequently, Si atoms leave the substrate and diffuse to pre-existing Si particles in cell walls and the triple junctions. Such a collective diffusion of Si atoms leads to the formation of coarse Si particles widespread in the Al matrix. Based on the XRD outputs, annealing for 15min had not any major effect on Ni-rich phases. however after 120min, a more brittle intermetallic shell of a Ni-rich phase formed on pre-exist coarse phases. The comparison of the mechanical properties of the Ni-reinforced AlSi10Mg alloy with those reinforced via the addition of other elements/compounds revealed that in a size range close to AlSi10Mg particles, Ni could not be an appropriate candidate for in-situ alloying through the LPBF method. Furthermore, spheroidization of the silicon particles and formation of fragile Ni-rich intermetallic shells having weak interfacial bonding to the Al matrix during the long-term annealing results in a significant reduction in mechanical strength of the specimens.},

The mixed of Fe-based amorphous reduces the grain diameter and eliminates the presence of texture. Meanwhile, the anisotropy of the specimen was reduced. The addition of Fe-based amorphous causes the precipitation of FCC phase in the body-centered cubic (BCC) matrix, and the face-centered cubic (FCC) phase is uniformly distributed at the grain boundaries. The presence of FCC phase significantly reduces the internal stress of the specimen. The elements in the amorphous alloy solidly dissolve into the BCC matrix during the printing process, further strengthening the BCC matrix. The residual amorphous and nanocrystalline phases also result in a significant improvement in the performance of the specimen.},

The best parameters were determined through extensive experiments. The relative density (95\%) and amorphous rate (95.47\%) samples were obtained by this parameter. The analysis of the microstructure reveals that the crystalline phases in the heat affected zone (HAZ) are mainly {$\alpha$}-Fe and M23(CB)6 phases, and co-exist with the amorphous phases. The Heat treatment is employed to study the crystallization behavior of amorphous phases. The {$\alpha$}-Fe phase, as the primary phase, grows into a submicron crystal phase under the action of multiple thermal cycles. Nanoindentation test results show that the hardness of the amorphous phase is higher than that of the nano-grain region, and the hardness of the nanocrystalline region is higher than that of the submicron-grain region. The free volume content is different and the amorphous phase is not uniform due to the complex thermal cycle. The maximum hardness occurs in the amorphous phase with 22.6GPa.},

  abstract = {Additive manufacturing of 25Cr super duplex stainless steel (SDSS) has been successfully demonstrated using laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF) in recent years. The as-built L-PBF 25Cr SDSS exhibits a microstructure that is close to 100\% ferritic (due to the fast cooling in L-PBF) and requires a high temperature thermal treatment to obtain the desired duplex structure. Directed laser deposition (DLD), as a variant of the additive manufacturing methods, is characterized by a much slower cooling rate than L-PBF and is potentially beneficial to achieve the duplex phase fraction in the as-deposited condition. DLD of 25Cr SDSS is new, the microstructure development and the mechanical properties remain unclear. The microstructure and mechanical properties of additively manufactured 25Cr SDSS produced by metal powder based DLD are reported in this work. The as-deposited microstructure revealed a balanced duplex structure, with a near 50/50 ferrite-austenite phase ratio, differences to the previously reported microstructure of SDSS produced by L-PBF are discussed. The mechanical properties of DLD 25Cr SDSS were investigated using uniaxial tensile testing and compared with the commercial wrought alloy. DLD 25Cr SDSS showed superior tensile strength to the commercial wrought alloy, the origin of the strength and strain hardening is discussed, and the flow strength for DLD and wrought 25Cr SDSS are described using a simple rule of mixtures model. The modelling supports the notion that the main difference between the mechanical response of the DLD 25Cr SDSS and the commercial alloy arises from the finer scale of the phases in the DLD SDSS. The findings demonstrate the feasibility of additive manufacturing using DLD as applied to 25Cr SDSS.},

  abstract = {Additive manufacturing (AM) has been increasingly developed and applied in many fields nowadays. However, it takes a long time for completing a part due to the layer-by-layer manner of AM process which is time-consuming. A variety of studies have been carried out to plan the process of AM to save fabrication time, such as increasing layer thickness to reduce total layer numbers and path planning to find the shortest total travel path to save printhead travel time. In this paper, a novel fabrication strategy for AM is proposed to save fabrication time. The novelty of this strategy is on the consideration that the part does not need to be fabricated in a layer-by-layer manner, but in a multilayer-by-multilayer manner when the part has some independent features. This strategy includes five steps. Firstly, the part needs to be positioned in an optimal print direction. Secondly, the independent features in this part needs to be detected. Thirdly, the closest distances between independent features in each sliced layer are calculated and recorded. Then the nozzle moving strategy between each independent feature can be generated based on the distance recorded in the previous step. Lastly, the part can be sent to the AM machine for final manufacture using the proposed novel fabrication strategy. A case study was carried out for validation. The results show that the proposed multilayer-by-multilayer strategy can save 1039s of time for fabricating the part in the case study, compared with conventional layer-by-layer method.},

At present, the investigation of the dynamic evolution of the microstructures during the laser cladding process is still limited. In this study, a multi-physics model was established to analyze the complex microstructure evolution process during the laser cladding of IN718. The model consists of heat and mass transfer process, polycrystalline solidification process, heterogeneous nucleation process with solute suppressed nucleation. The accuracy of the model was verified by comparing the profile of the molten pool calculated by the heat and mass transfer model and the solidification microstructures of the molten pool calculated by the polycrystalline solidification model with the experimental results. The results show that thermal convection is the main heat transfer mode in the molten pool. The decrease of the line energy decreases the flow velocity pool and weakens the thermal convection in the molten pool. Columnar grains are composed of epitaxial growth grains and elongated grains nucleated between the primary branches. The columnar-to-equiaxed transition (CET) is affected by the size of "active nucleation zone (ANZ)", and the size of equiaxed grain is affected by the size of "inhibited nucleation zone (INZ)". The decrease of line energy leads to the decrease of the area of both the ANZ and INZ, which leads to the increase of the area of the columnar grain zone, but the decrease of the equiaxed grain size.},

However, challenges still exist in the additive manufacturing process, such as mismatched material properties, lack of build consistency, and pervasive imperfections in the printed part. These inherent challenges can be avoided by implementing algorithms to detect imperfections and modulate printing parameters in real time. In this paper, several algorithms, with a focus on machine learning methods, are reviewed and explored to systematically tackle the three main stages of the additive manufacturing process: geometrical design, process parameter configuration, and in situ anomaly detection. Current challenges and future opportunities for algorithmically driven additive manufacturing processes, as well as potential applications to other manufacturing methods, are also discussed.},

Therefore, having a good grasp of the mechanism of various structural defects is useful for guiding process maps. However, investigating melt-pool dynamics and corresponding defects using experiments is challenging. Numerical simulation thus represents a promising and visual way to reproduce these phenomena. In this study, predicated to first ensure accuracy, a two-dimensional (2D) model was numerically implemented by a phase field with a finite element method (FEM). Our model emphasises the interaction between neighbouring powders during heat duration with time-varying maximum intensity under different deposition parameters. Our simulation results indicate that the reinforcement of liquidity can significantly enhance the wettability of the neighbouring powder to release gas bubbles and extend the melt pool. Similarly, the remelting process also effectively eliminates porosity, which yields a smooth surface deposited in the previous layers to improve deposit densification. Our simulation also provided detailed insights into the evolution of liquid metal droplets away from ``the elongated neck'' and investigated the effect of scanning speed on the width of the melt pool of single tracks. Additionally, our model implemented a discrete FEM method with extremely refined free-triangle elements, which was accompanied by a decrease in computational cost and expressed good agreement with the experiments.},

  abstract = {The CrMnFeCoNi high-entropy alloy demonstrates a promising potential for applications over a range of temperature. The alloy also shows excellent printability to be fabricated by additive manufacturing for complex structures. Nevertheless, there are limited studies on the thermo-mechanical behaviour of the alloy, in particular when fabricated by laser powder-bed fusion. This study provides an in-depth understanding of the relationship between as-built cellular microstructures and fatigue behaviour at a range of temperatures (22\textendash 600~\textdegree C) in particular concerning the stability of dislocation cells and thermo-mechanical dependence of the fatigue behaviour of the alloy. At all tested temperatures, the alloy exhibits a very short duration cyclic hardening with a low hardening rate followed by a cyclic softening. The high density of dislocations already existing in as-built condition were able to accommodate most of the prescribed strain. Hence, only a small number of mobile dislocations needs to be generated, causing a short cyclic hardening phase. Upon further loading, the back stress associated with the long-range stress field was dominant factor governing the cyclic softening behaviour. The similitude relationship provided insights into the stability of as-built cells, in particular it explains why the size of as-built cells did not change during cyclic loading at 22~\textdegree C. The significant reduction in dislocation density due to the increased annihilation rate and untanglement of dislocation substructures thanks mainly to thermal assistance at elevated temperatures led to a decrease in cyclic strength and related properties (yield stress, friction and back stress, hysteresis loop shape parameter and energy per cycle). The LPBF HEA shows an insignificant strain rate dependence of the primary cyclic hardening and softening in the range of 10-3s-1 and 10-2s-1. However, the dynamic strain ageing results in a secondary cyclic hardening at 400~\textdegree C and the reversed strain sensitivity at temperatures from 200\textdegree{} to 400~\textdegree C. The fracture mode was transgranular at 22\textendash 400~\textdegree C but changed to more intergranular-like at 600~\textdegree C due to the decohesion of grain boundaries, resulting in a reduction in fatigue life.},

Consequently, tens to hundreds of materials and part design degrees of freedom must be simultaneously controlled and understood; hence, metals AM is a highly interdisciplinary technology that requires synchronized consideration of physics, chemistry, materials science, physical metallurgy, computer science, electrical engineering, and mechanical engineering. The use of modern machine learning approaches to model these degrees of freedom can reduce the time and cost to elucidate the science of metals AM and to optimize the engineering of these complex, multidisciplinary processes. New machine learning techniques are not needed for most metals AM development; those used in other sects of materials science will also work for AM. Most prolifically, the density functional theory (DFT) community has used many of them since the early 2000s for evaluating numerous combinations of elements and crystal structures to discover new materials. This materials technologies-focused review introduces the basic mathematics and terminology of machine learning through the lens of metals AM, and then examines potential uses of machine learning to advance metals AM, highlighting the many parallels to previous efforts in materials science and manufacturing while also discussing new challenges and adaptations specific to metals AM.},

LSP can be applied selectively in the 3D volume of metallic parts, and is shown to influence the bulk internal stress state and hardness, as well as the distribution of porosities in the material. Here, a decoupled 3D LSP process was used, i.e. LSP treatments were applied during the SLM process, by removing the sample from the SLM chamber whenever needed. We report fatigue lives of 316 L stainless steel multiplied by more than 15 times compared to standard SLM parts, and more than 57 times compared to conventional manufacturing, with a significant improvement over other state-of-the art methods. The effect of the 3D LSP treatment on SLM parts and the consequence on crack initiation and propagation is investigated by measuring the near surface residual stresses, imaging the fractured surface, measuring the porosity content and analyzing the microstructure and microhardness.},

Caused by the recoating system, the powder may have uneven roughness or unwanted structures such as waviness. One consequence of these conditions may be for example that the fabricated structure contains porosity.

The dimensional data of the powder bed surface can be rapidly evaluated and, moreover, relevant parameters can be obtained with this statistical tool, allowing for in- or off-line process assessment.},

  abstract = {Integrated computational materials engineering (ICME) methods combining CALPHAD with process-based simulations can produce rich, high-dimensional data for alloy and process design. In ICME methods for metallurgical applications, the visualization and interpretation of such high-dimensional data has previously been through heat maps represented in 2 or 3 dimensions. While such an approach is ideal when one variable is varied at a time, in the case of high-dimensional data with multiple variables varied simultaneously, as is the case in additive manufacturing, interpreting the trends through two- or three-dimensional heat maps becomes challenging. Here, we propose a strategy of mixed visual data mining and quantitative analysis for high-dimensional metallurgical and process data using high-throughput thermodynamic calculations. Two case studies show the application of the proposed approach. The first case study investigated the effects of feedstock chemistry on the ferrite formation in 316L stainless steel powders used for binder jet additive manufacturing. The second case study linked Scheil\textendash Gulliver calculations to a process model for dissimilar joining of aluminum alloys 5356 and 6111 during laser hot-wire additive manufacturing. Both cases contained thousands of calculated data points, showcasing the utility of visual data analysis through parallel coordinate plotting, Pearson correlation coefficient matrices, and scatter matrices compared to traditional process maps. These visualization techniques can be extended to many additive manufacturing problems to capture process\textendash structure\textendash property relationships for additively manufactured components.},

  abstract = {Large thermal gradients in the melt pool from rapid heating followed by rapid cooling in metal additive manufacturing generate large thermoelectric currents. Applying an external magnetic field to the process introduces fluid flow through thermoelectric magnetohydrodynamics. Convective transport of heat and mass can then modify the melt pool dynamics and alter microstructural evolution. As a novel technique, this shows great promise in controlling the process to improve quality and mitigate defect formation. However, there is very little knowledge within the scientific community on the fundamental principles of this physical phenomenon to support practical implementation. To address this multi-physics problem that couples the key phenomena of melting/solidification, electromagnetism, hydrodynamics, heat and mass transport, the lattice Boltzmann method for fluid dynamics was combined with a purpose-built code addressing solidification modelling and electromagnetics. The theoretical study presented here investigates the hydrodynamic mechanisms introduced by the magnetic field. The resulting steady-state solutions of modified melt pool shapes and thermal fields are then used to predict the microstructure evolution using a cellular automata-based grain growth model. The results clearly demonstrate that the hydrodynamic mechanisms and, therefore, microstructure characteristics are strongly dependent on magnetic field orientation.

  abstract = {This paper reviews the past and recent studies on thermocapillarity in relation to microfluidics. The role of thermocapillarity as the change of surface tension due to temperature gradient in developing Marangoni flow in liquid films and conclusively bubble and drop actuation is discussed. The thermocapillary-driven mass transfer (the so-called Benard-Marangoni effect) can be observed in liquid films, reservoirs, bubbles and droplets that are subject to the temperature gradient. Since the contribution of a surface tension-driven flow becomes more prominent when the scale becomes smaller as compared to a pressure-driven flow, microfluidic applications based on thermocapillary effect are gaining attentions recently. The effect of thermocapillarity on the flow pattern inside liquid films is the initial focus of this review. Analysis of the relation between evaporation and thermocapillary instability approves the effect of Marangoni flow on flow field inside the drop and its evaporation rate. The effect of thermocapillary on producing Marangoni flow inside drops and liquid films, leads to actuation of drops and bubbles due to the drag at the interface, mass conservation, and also gravity and buoyancy in vertical motion. This motion can happen inside microchannels with a closed multiphase medium, on the solid substrate as in solid/liquid interaction, or on top of a carrier liquid film in open microfluidic systems. Various thermocapillary-based microfluidic devices have been proposed and developed for different purposes such as actuation, sensing, trapping, sorting, mixing, chemical reaction, and biological assays throughout the years. A list of the thermocapillary based microfluidic devices along with their characteristics, configurations, limitations, and improvements are presented in this review.},

In this study, casting solidification condition was mimicked, and in situ recrystallization was promoted in EB-PBF to facilitate columnar-to-equiaxed grain structure transition in Alloy 718. This is achieved via a unique linear melting strategy coupled with a specific selection of process parameters in EB-PBF. It was found that site-specific melting using line order number (LON) function affected the cooling rate and temperature gradient, which controlled grain morphology and texture. A high LON resulted in a large equiaxed grain zone with a random texture, whereas a fixed LON with a high areal energy density led to a strong texture. The main driving force in the formation of cracks and shrinkage defects during the transition was investigated. A high LON at a fixed areal energy density reduced the average total shrinkage defects and crack length. The hardness was decreased through the transition, which was linked to the reduction in the size of the {$\gamma$}ʺ precipitates.},

For this transition, a specific combination of certain process parameters, including low scanning speeds (400\textendash 800\,mm/s), wide line offsets (300\textendash 500\,{$\mu$}m) and a high number of line order (\#10) was selected to control local solidification conditions in each melt pool during the process. In addition, secondary melting of each layer with a 90\textdegree{} rotation with respect to primary melting induced more vigorous motions within the melt pools and extensive changes in thermal gradient direction, facilitating grain morphology tailoring. Four different types of microstructures were classified according to the produced grain morphology depending on the overlap zone between two adjacent melt pools, i.e., fully-columnar (overlap above 40\,\%), fully-equiaxed (overlap below 15\,\%), mixed columnar-equiaxed grains, and hemispherical melt pools containing mixed columnar-equiaxed grains (overlap {$\sim$}20\textendash 25\,\%). The typical texture was {$<$}001{$>$}; however, the texture was reduced significantly through the transition from the columnar to equiaxed grain morphology. Along with all four different microstructures, shrinkage defects and cracks were also identified which amount of them reduced by a reduction in areal energy input. The hardness was increased through the transition, which was linked to the growth of the {$\gamma$}ʺ precipitates and high grain boundary density in the fully-equiaxed grain morphology.},

Moreover, solving inverse problems with hidden physics is often prohibitively expensive and requires different formulations and elaborate computer codes. Machine learning has emerged as a promising alternative, but training deep neural networks requires big data, not always available for scientific problems. Instead, such networks can be trained from additional information obtained by enforcing the physical laws (for example, at random points in the continuous space-time domain). Such physics-informed learning integrates (noisy) data and mathematical models, and implements them through neural networks or other kernel-based regression networks. Moreover, it may be possible to design specialized network architectures that automatically satisfy some of the physical invariants for better accuracy, faster training and improved generalization. Here, we review some of the prevailing trends in embedding physics into machine learning, present some of the current capabilities and limitations and discuss diverse applications of physics-informed learning both for forward and inverse problems, including discovering hidden physics and tackling high-dimensional problems.},

Since synthesizing of such powders is complicated and expensive, an issue of in-situ processing becomes relevant and is increasingly studied nowadays. The main idea of in-situ alloying assisted processing, namely the alloying/reaction occurring between materials of different powders, can be implemented at three principally separate processing stages: pre-processing (raw material preparation), printing itself and post-processing (sintering/infiltration/heat-treatment). The presented brief review gives a necessary background for in-situ alloying at the mostly employed pre-process, process and post-process stages relevant for Powder Bed Fusion (PBF), Direct Energy Deposition (DED) and Binder Jet Printing (BJP) technologies. The presented survey discusses the involved physical processes with their relevance for each mentioned AM technologies and proposes a novel methodology for designing new materials.},

Geometric and thermal features of the simulated melt pools are extracted and used in subsequent mesoscale simulations. Solidification in the melt pool is simulated on two length scales. For the multicomponent alloy Inconel 625, microsegregation between dendrite arms is calculated using the Scheil-Gulliver solidification model and DICTRA software. Phase-field simulations, using Ni-Nb as a binary analogue to Inconel 625, produced microstructures with primary cellular/dendritic arm spacings in agreement with measured spacings in experimentally observed microstructures and a lesser extent of microsegregation than predicted by DICTRA simulations. The composition profiles are used to compare thermodynamic driving forces for nucleation against experimentally observed precipitates identified by electron and X-ray diffraction analyses. Our analysis lists the precipitates that may form from FCC phase of enriched interdendritic compositions and compares these against experimentally observed phases from 1 h heat treatments at two temperatures: stress relief at 1143 K (870 \textdegree C) or homogenization at 1423 K (1150 \textdegree C).},

Here, a {$\gamma$}/{$\gamma$}'-strengthened Ni-8Cr-5.5Al-1Ti (wt\%) model alloy is studied, as a simplified version of the commercial CM247LC alloy, by melting pre-alloyed powders in which 0.5\textendash 1~wt\% Y2O3 nanoparticles were added via mechanical alloying. The Y2O3 nanoparticles follow three distinct paths. First, the strong affinity between Y2O3 and Al leads to the formation of Y4Al2O9 slag which floats on the melt pool; if in excess, the slag leads to vertically aligned mm-size cavities, preventing complete consolidation of the alloy. Second, a high number density of oxide nanodispersoids is distributed within the alloy's grain inducing a strong (100) texture and noticeably reduces grain size compared to the unmodified base alloy. Third, despite the high stability of Y2O3, the extreme temperatures achieved in the melt pool decompose some of the Y2O3 precipitates leading to the formation of Ni- and Y-rich particles (16~nm in radius) and Y segregation to the alloy's grain boundaries. The local composition on cracked grain boundaries is consistent with Ni17Y2 having an embrittling and liquation effect. Based on these results, the critical role of Al in reacting with oxide nanodispersoids during L-PBF manufacturing is discussed, and various types of potentially more successful dispersoids are suggested.},

As of now, the post-processing technique is witnessed as the only sustainable approach to enhance the mechanical and microstructural performance of the additive products since any further optimization of the LPBF processing parameters is reported inefficient in bringing the relevant changes in the as-built LPBF parts. So far, several post-processing techniques such as thermal, mechanical, and/or chemical-based have been applied to different additive materials, and the results have been beneficial. This article reviews the effects of post-processing operations on the surface integrity properties of as-built LPBF parts, namely surface roughness, microhardness, microstructure, mechanical strength, corrosion, and wear resistance. The results of the post-processing operations are also discussed and compared with the as-built and conventional conditions for different engineering materials.},

  abstract = {A finite element method based three-dimensional heat transfer model with adaptive remeshing is presented to simulate the building of multiple tracks and layers in laser powder bed fusion of metallic powders with enhanced computational competence. A dimensional analysis is undertaken to define the heat source dimensions as function of laser parameters and properties of alloy powder. The computational model is used to calculate the melt pool cross sections for multiple combinations of laser power and scanning velocities considering multi-track-multi-layer builds of SS316L powder. The computed results are verified extensively with the corresponding experimentally measured ones. The model is utilized further to examine its ability to predict defects such as melt track discontinuity and incomplete fusion between neighboring tracks and layers. Overall, the adaptive remeshing and the proposed heat source expression could significantly enhance the model competence by reducing the computational time and memory while maintaining the accuracy of results in simulating laser powder bed fusion of multiple tracks and layers.}

  abstract = {CrMnFeCoNi high-entropy alloys (HEAs) exhibit an excellent combination of tensile strength and ductility at cryogenic temperatures. This study led to the introduction of a new method for the development of high-performance CrMnFeCoNi HEAs at cryogenic temperatures by jointly utilizing additive manufacturing (AM) and the addition of interstitial atoms. The interstitial oxygen present in the powder feedstock was transformed into beneficial nano-sized oxides during AM processing. The HEA nanocomposite fabricated using laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF) not only contains heterogeneous grains and substructures but also a high number density of nano-sized oxides. The tensile results revealed that the L-PBF HEA nanocomposite has superior yield strengths of 0.77 GPa and 1.15 GPa, and tensile strengths of 0.92 GPa and 1.45 GPa at 298 K and 77 K, respectively. In addition, the Charpy impact energies of the samples tested at 298 K and 77 K were measured as 176.2 J and 103.7 J, respectively. These results indicate that the L-PBF HEA nanocomposite successfully overcomes the well-known strength-toughness trade-off. The tensile deformation microstructure contained a relatively large number of deformation twins (DTs) at cryogenic temperature, a possible consequence of the decrease in the stacking fault energy with decreasing temperature. On the other hand, cracks were found to propagate along the grain boundaries at room temperature, whereas a transgranular crack was observed at cryogenic temperature in the specimens fractured as a result of the Charpy impact.},

  abstract = {The present study has investigated the high temperature creep behavior of equiatomic CoCrFeMnNi high-entropy alloy (HEA) manufactured via selective laser melting (SLM). Additionally, the effect of in situ oxide, formed during SLM, on the creep property was examined. The SLM-built HEA exhibited a heterogeneous microstructure as well as cellular and columnar structures decorated by dislocations. Nanosized oxides were newly formed at the substructure boundaries due to high oxygen content in the pre-alloyed powders. SLM-built HEA with in-situ formed oxide revealed exceptional creep resistance at 600\,\textdegree C, as compared to other HEAs, and stress exponents of n = 3.45 and n = 6.45 for low stress region (LSR) and high stress region (HSR), respectively. This indicated that the creep mechanisms of SLM-built HEA were viscous glide at the LSR and dislocation climb at the HSR. The activation energy for creep was determined to be 335\,kJ/mol, which was similar to the activation energy of self-diffusion of the constituent elements. The prediction of the Cottrell-Jaswon dragging model on the steady-state creep rate for the SLM-built HEA was that the most sluggish species of the Ni element encouraged the solute drag phenomenon in the LSR. After the creep tests, the SLM-built HEA exhibited an accumulation of geometrically necessary dislocations at the substructure boundaries, unlike in other metallic materials, where the dislocations are concentrated at the grain boundaries. The nanosized oxides that formed during SLM suppressed the dislocation movement and acted as a site of dislocation accumulation. These results could suggest a way for improving the high-temperature creep resistance of HEAs using unique microstructures (i.e., sub-structures decorated by dislocations and in-situ-formed oxide via high oxygen content in pre-alloy powders) developed by additive manufacturing.},

Here, a strategy to additionally enhance the strength of selective laser melted carbon-containing HEAs was investigated. The as\textendash built carbon-containing HEAs (Cx(Cr20Mn20Fe20Co20Ni20)100\textendash x (x\,=\,0.5 at.\%, 1.0 at.\%, and 1.5 at.\%)) contain supersaturated carbon, and the extent of supersaturation increases as the carbon content increases. When subjected to aging treatment at 650\textdegree C for 1~h, the microstructure of the three alloys did not change at the grain scale. However, the microstructure at the sub-grain scale changed markedly, and these changes influenced the tensile properties and deformation mechanism. In particular, the tensile strength of aged 1.5C\textendash HEA at 650\textdegree C was {$\sim$}1.2 GPa at room temperature, which is higher than those reported for CrMnFeCoNi HEAs. Furthermore, the main deformation mechanism changed from deformation twinning to dislocation-mediated slip, resulting in much higher strain hardening capacity after the aging treatment. This work led to the development of an alternative promising method that involves tailoring the microstructure, to enhance the mechanical properties of additively manufactured metallic materials that contain interstitial atoms.},

Another important aspect is the control of process stability which could be endangered by collisions between super-elevated part regions and the recoating mechanism. For that reason this paper presents two different approaches. The first system consists of a high resolution imaging setup. The second system uses an acceleration sensor to measure vibrations during the powder deposition. Furthermore this approach can be used to train the image analysis detection threshold.

Porosity fraction, grain structure, phases, and crystallographic texture per phase are characterized using micro X-ray computed tomography, microscopy, and neutron diffraction. A hierarchical structure of acicular {$\alpha$}-phase morphology formed inside the prior {$\beta$} grains by fast cooling during LPBF transforms into fine-grained globular microstructure by THRM, which facilitates homogeneous nucleation and growth of the low temperature phase with some retained {$\beta$} phase. Moreover, hydrogenated material during THRM has low activation energy for diffusion, which in conjunction with the surface energy of pores causes densification of the material, thereby closing porosity formed during LPBF. Such significant microstructural changes induced by the THRM treatment cause brittle material created by LPBF to become ductile. Significantly, the strength and ductility produced by THRM exceed the minimums set forth by the ASTM B348 standard. Moreover, the treatment improves fatigue strength of the material. In particular, it improves the endurance limit and reduces the scatter in the measured fatigue strength data. Performance characteristics of the material can be further optimized for specific application requirements by tailoring microstructures using the LPBF and THRM processes.},

  abstract = {In-situ alloying has been proven as a cost-effective, flexible and advantageous method for laser powder bed fusion (LPBF). Novel alloy development and exploration of, for example high entropy alloys in additive manufacturing, can benefit from this, due to the large number of potential elemental combinations and graduations that can be alloyed in-situ at relatively low cost. However, studies to date have not reported the role of powder characteristics in mixed feedstocks, which may in turn have significant impacts on the process and resultant bulk material properties. This has not been explored with in-situ alloying in literature thus far. In the present work, 4 different powder blends were prepared, processed with LBPF and characterized to reveal the relationships between the particle size distribution (PSD), the powder morphology and their effect on the rheology, powder bed density, bulk density, microstructure and chemical homogeneity. For this purpose, various commercial and elemental powders with different morphology and PSD were used for powder blending. It is shown that a highly homogenous alloy can be created using spherical, bi-modally distributed powder containing between 21 and 30~vol\% {$<$} 15~{$\mu$}m spherical particles to maximize the powder bed density and create a homogenous and refined bulk structure via LPBF. This research enables the community to optimize in-situ alloying powder blends by providing additional information on how the influence of fine size fractions within powder blends impacts processability, homogeneity and resulting microstructure. This information is valuable for rapidly engineering functional properties in emergent alloys developed for LPBF.},

In this paper it is depicted that the wavelength dependent Fresnel absorption of the laser at the keyhole front is responsible for a different propagation and amplification or attenuation of instabilities at the keyhole front and the keyhole dynamics. To understand the physics of laser deep penetration welding and the interaction of the melt pool dynamics with these instabilities a three dimensional transient simulation of laser keyhole welding process has been developed. The results obtained by this simulation help to understand the different aspects of the formation of instabilities in the keyhole front at different wavelengths. To investigate the implication of the wavelength dependent absorption effects a CO2-laser and an Yb:YAG-laser are simulated. The presented model includes the calculation of the heat flux in the solid and molten phase and a temperature dependent melting and solidification model. The 3D velocity field inside the melt pool and the keyhole is calculated. The free surface of the melt pool is modelled using the Volume of Fluid method.},

In this study, a novel high-strength Fe85Cr4Mo8V2C1 tool steel processed by LPBF and by casting was examined in a comparative study. By means of scanning electron microscopy (SEM), electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) for both conditions a microstructure composed of martensite, austenite and complex carbides was detected. Very high cooling rates of LPBF yield a significant microstructural refinement across the building direction with much more homogenous distribution of the principal phases compared with the cast counterparts. The corrosion behaviour was investigated in NaCl solutions by means of potentiodynamic polarization measurements as well as surface analysis with SEM and X-ray photo electron spectroscopy (XPS) after immersion testing. Particulary in more aggressive solutions where active dissolution dominates, i.e. in 3.5\% NaCl (pH 7) and in 0.035\% NaCl (pH 3), the LPBF samples exhibit a retarded corrosion activity according to more positive corrosion potentials and significantly lower corrosion current densities as well as reduced anodic current densities. A wave-like corrosion pattern was detected reflecting melt track-related microstructural features, i.e. local grain coarsening and preferred crystal orientation. In milder solution, 0.035\% NaCl (pH 7), Fe85Cr4Mo8V2C1 exhibits for both processing conditions relatively low free corrosion rates. For LPBF samples a complex, fine grain boundary network supports the formation of thicker but slightly more permeable layers composed mainly of iron oxides which retard the corrosion activity especially at higher anodic polarization.},

Hatching strategies and beam parameters as beam power, scan velocity and line offset significantly affect the grain structure of the manufactured part. While experiments reveal the result of specific parameter combinations, the precise impact of distinct parameters on the resulting grain structure is widely unknown. This knowledge is necessary for a reliable prediction of the microstructure and consequently the mechanical properties of the manufactured part. We introduce the adaption of a three-dimensional model for the prediction of dendritic growth for use with PBF. The heat input is calculated using an analytical solution of the transient heat conduction equation. Massively parallel processing on a high-performance cluster computer allows the computation of the grain structure on the scale of small parts within reasonable times. The model is validated by accurately reproducing experimental grain structures of Inconel 718 test specimens manufactured by selective electron beam melting. The grain selection zone within the first layers as well as the subsequent microstructure in several millimeters build height is modeled in unprecedented level of detail. This model represents the cutting-edge of grain structure simulation in PBF and enables a reliable numerical prediction of appropriate beam parameters for arbitrary applications.},

  abstract = {The development of novel alloys specifically designed for additive manufacturing (AM) is a key factor in using the full potential of AM. This study addresses the design of advanced high strength steels (AHSS) that take advantage of the processing conditions during AM by laser powder bed fusion (LPBF). The alloy screening was guided by computational alloy selection (combined CALPHAD, Scheil-Gulliver, and phase-field simulations) and by rapid processing using powder blends (X30Mn21 steel and Al). Increasing Al contents, ranging from 0 to 5.4\,wt. \%, promoted bcc-fcc solidification, and allowed for tailoring the stacking fault energy (SFE). On the one hand, the transition from fcc to bcc-fcc solidification enabled controlling the microstructure and texture evolution during AM. On the other hand, the wide SFE range between 8\,J/m{$^2$} (0\,wt. \% Al) and 44\,J/m{$^2$} (5.4\,wt. \% Al) promoted flexible adjustment of the active deformation mechanisms, including transformation-induced plasticity (TRIP) and twinning-induced plasticity (TWIP), to govern the work-hardening behavior. The microstructure after LPBF and after plastic deformation was analyzed by XRD, SEM, EDX, EBSD, EPMA, and TEM. Mechanical properties of bulk specimens and lattice structures were analyzed using tensile and compression testing with a focus on energy absorption capacity. The influence of the chemical composition and the solidification conditions during LPBF on the microstructure evolution and the related microstructure-property-relationships of bulk and lattice structure specimens will be discussed.},

The availability of AM data provides Design for AM (DfAM) with a newfound opportunity to construct AM design rules with improved understanding of AM's influence on part qualities. To seize the opportunity, this paper proposes a novel approach for AM design rule construction based on machine learning and knowledge graph. First, this paper presents a framework that enables i) deploying machine learning for extracting knowledge on predictive additive manufacturability from data, ii) adopting ontology with knowledge graphs as a knowledge base for storing both a priori and newfound AM knowledge, iii) reasoning with knowledge for deriving data-driven prescriptive AM design rules. Second, this paper presents a methodology that constructs knowledge on predictive additive manufacturability and prescriptive AM design rules. In the methodology, we formalize knowledge representations, extractions, and reasoning, which enhances automated and autonomous constructions and improvements of AM design rules. The methodology then employs a machine learning algorithm of Classification and Regression Tree on measurement data from National Institute of Standards and Technology for a construction of a Laser Powder Bed Fusion-specific design rule for overhang features. This work supports AI related DfAM systems, as it helps AI related decision-making in additive manufacturability analysis and product design/re-design for AM and guides machine learning to addressing problems related to AM design rules. This work is also meaningful as it provides sharable AM design rule knowledge with the AM society.},

Both dislocation enrichment and elemental segregation (Mo and Cr) at the cellular boundary contribute to the high strength of the LPBF parts; however, nano-indentation tests indicate that the blocking ability of the cellular structure for dislocation motion is weaker compared with the typical grain boundary.},

As a peculiar feature, sub-micro cellular structures widely exist in additively manufactured (AM) metallic materials. This phenomenon primarily appears with high-density dislocations and segregated elements or precipitates at the cellular boundaries. The discovery of novel metastable substructures in various alloys through numerous investigations has proven their substantial effects on the engineering properties of AM components. This paper reviews the most recent research momentum regarding the formation mechanisms (elemental segregation, dislocation cell and oxide inclusion), the kinetics of the size and morphology, the growth orientation and the thermodynamic stability of these cellular structures by taking AM austenitic stainless steel as an exemplary material. Another topic of concern here is the inherent correlation between the unique cellular microstructure and the corresponding mechanical properties (strength, ductility, fatigue, etc.) and corrosion responses (passivity, irradiation damage, hydrogen embrittlement, etc.) for this category of AM materials. The design, control, and optimization of cellular structures for additive manufacturing techniques are expected to inspire new strategies for advancing high-performance structural alloy development.},

Classical approaches based on locally refined finite elements combined with time-stepping schemes can only address the spatial multi-scale nature and provide only limited scaling potential for massively parallel computations. We address these shortcomings in a space-time Galerkin framework where the finite element interpolation also includes the temporal direction. In this setting, we construct four-dimensional meshes that are locally refined towards the laser spot and allow for varying temporal accuracy depending on the position in space. By splitting the mesh into conforming time slabs, we recover a stepwise solution to solve the space-time problem locally in time at this slab; additionally, we can choose time-slab sizes significantly larger than classical time-stepping schemes. As a result, we believe this setting to be well suited for large-scale parallelization. In our work, we use a continuous Galerkin-Petrov formulation of the nonlinear heat equation with an apparent heat capacity model to account for the phase change. We validate our approach by computing the AMB2018-02 benchmark, where we obtain an excellent agreement with the measured melt pool shape. Using the same setup, we demonstrate the performance potential of our approach by hatching a square area with a laser path length of about one meter.},

  abstract = {This study presents a fair performance comparison of the continuous finite element method, the symmetric interior penalty discontinuous Galerkin method, and the hybridized discontinuous Galerkin method. Modern implementations of high-order methods with state-of-the-art multigrid solvers for the Poisson equation are considered, including fast matrix-free implementations with sum factorization on quadrilateral and hexahedral elements. For the hybridized discontinuous Galerkin method, a multigrid approach that combines a grid transfer from the trace space to the space of linear finite elements with algebraic multigrid on further levels is developed. Despite similar solver complexity of the matrix-based HDG solver and matrix-free geometric multigrid schemes with continuous and discontinuous Galerkin finite elements, the latter offer up to order of magnitude faster time to solution, even after including the superconvergence effects. This difference is because of vastly better performance of matrix-free operator evaluation as compared to sparse matrix-vector products. A roofline performance model confirms the advantage of the matrix-free implementation.},

The approach is based entirely on two homogeneous methods, such as cellular automata and Lattice Boltzmann. The model components operate in the common domain allowing for linking them into a more complex holistic numerical model with the possibility to complete full-scale calculations eliminating complicated interfaces. Several physical events, occurring in sequence or simultaneously, are currently considered including powder bed deposition, laser energy absorption and heating of the powder bed by the moving laser beam leading to powder melting, fluid flow in the melted pool, flow through partly or not melted materials and solidification. The possibilities and benefits of the proposed solution are demonstrated through a series of benchmark cases, as well as model verifications. The presented case studies deal mainly with melting and solidification of the powder bed including the free surface flow, wettability, and surface tension. An example of process simulation shows that the approach is generic and can be applied to different multi-material SLM processes, where energy transfer including solid\textendash liquid phase transformation is essential, by integrating the developed models within the proposed framework.},

By combining this ansatz with a special quadrature technique, one can regain spectral convergence properties for low-regularity solutions, which is demonstrated by numerical examples.

  abstract = {Powder bed fusion (PBF) is an additive manufacturing process that allows for the production of individual metal parts with high geometric freedom. An additional degree of freedom can be introduced by multi-material fabrication, i.e. the processing of a powder mixture from different materials. This can be used to perform in situ alloying or to produce functionally graded parts. The thereby increased complexity intensifies the need to simulate the PBF process in order to replace costly and time-consuming experiments. In this paper, a multi-material model for the lattice Boltzmann-based simulation of the mixing of two elements to a binary alloy via PBF is presented. Its foundation is a consistent thermodynamic model comprised of the mass, momentum and enthalpy conservation equations, including element-specific mass conservation and the often neglected physical effect of enthalpy diffusion. Based on this, the material model considers concentration-dependent material parameters such as heat capacities and latent heats. In particular, melting and solidification are modelled in accordance with the phase diagram, for which the example of an isomorphous one is given. The comparison of simulation results with analytical calculations shows excellent agreement for different scenarios, in which the transport phenomena of diffusion and heat conduction are verified. Regarding the PBF process, the simulation of a single melt track in a multi-material powder mixture predicts the partitioning of the melt pool into an inner well-mixed region surrounded by melt of the lower-melting component. A multi-track and multi-layer simulation, which illustrates the build-up of a compact sample, shows that unmolten particles as well as a very high surface roughness are possible unwanted side effects in multi-material PBF.},

The SHLL method is a purely vector-split approximation of the classical HLL method (Harten et al., 1983 [1]) which assumes the presence of local wave propagation in the algebraic derivation of fluxes across cell surfaces. The conventional HLL flux expression terms are interface-split and wave propagation velocities estimated (where required) based on local conditions. Due to the highly local nature of the SHLL fluxes, the scheme is very efficiently applied to GPU computation since the flux, initialisation and update phases of the computation are all vectorized processes. The SHLL scheme is applied to GPU computating using Nvidia's CUDA package. Numerical schemes are presented for solutions to the general transport (convection\textendash diffusion) equation, Euler Equations and Shallow Water Equations with results presented for several benchmark gas and shallow water flow engineering problems. Computational times are compared between high-end GPU (Nvidia C1060) and CPU (Intel Xeon 3.0GHz, 32MB cache) systems with reported speedups of over 67 times when applied to two dimensional simulations with multi-million cell numbers.},

The approach enables the digital control of the processing parameters and thus the resulting alloy's microstructure, for example, by using high cooling rates and cyclic re-heating4-10. We recently showed that this cyclic re-heating, the so-called intrinsic heat treatment, can trigger nickel-aluminium precipitation in an iron-nickel-aluminium alloy in situ during laser additive manufacturing9. Here we report a Fe19Ni5Ti (weight per cent) steel tailor-designed for laser additive manufacturing. This steel is hardened in situ by nickel-titanium nanoprecipitation, and martensite is~also formed in situ, starting at a readily accessible temperature of 200 degrees Celsius. Local control of both the nanoprecipitation and the martensitic transformation during the fabrication leads to complex microstructure hierarchies across multiple length scales, from approximately 100-micrometre-thick layers down to nanoscale precipitates. Inspired by ancient Damascus steels11-14-which have hard and soft layers, originally introduced via the folding and forging techniques of skilled blacksmiths-we produced a material consisting of alternating soft and hard layers. Our material has a tensile strength of 1,300 megapascals and 10 per cent elongation, showing superior mechanical properties to those of ancient Damascus steel12. The principles of in situ precipitation strengthening and local microstructure control used here can be applied to a wide range of precipitation-hardened alloys and different additive manufacturing processes.},

The microstructure of Ti-6Al-4V alloy fabricated by SLM and followed by post heat treatment intricately contributes to the mechanical properties. In this study, the microstructural features were quantitatively extracted from the scanning electron microscopy images by applying machine learning with a random forest algorithm and various image analysis techniques. These microstructural features together with defect-characterizing ones from X-ray computed tomography were used to develop a prediction model by multiple linear regression analysis for the tensile properties of heat-treated SLMed Ti-6Al-4V alloys. The analysis revealed that both yield strength ({$\sigma$}YS) and ultimate tensile strength ({$\sigma$}UTS) have a linear correlation with the reciprocal square root of the {$\alpha$} grain size, and they were also attributed to other microstructural features depending on solution treatment parameters. The multiple linear regression models showed an error of less than 2.0\% for {$\sigma$}YS and {$\sigma$}UTS prediction accuracies. On the other hand, the prediction of the fracture elongation and elasticity had significant scatter, implying that there are features, such as dislocation characteristics, that are missing for proper prediction.},

Two types of MPEAs with different chemical compositions are obtained by laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) using gas-atomized pre-alloyed powders. Both MPEAs as-built products have columnar crystal structures with face-centered cubic (fcc) phase matrices. In the solution and aging heat treatment, columnar crystal grains transform into equiaxial recrystallized grains with precipitates dispersed in the fcc matrix. The alloys exhibit ultimate tensile strength over 1,500 MPa and corrosion rates of less than 1 mm/year in boiling 10\% H2SO4. The microcellular structures formed in the LPBF process, and the precipitates formed after heat treatments can affect the mechanical properties and corrosion behavior. The higher cobalt and chromium content of the proposed CoCrFeNiTi-based MPEA and the microstructure control in heat treatments demonstrate their effectiveness in retarding acid corrosion.

We consider incompressible fluids obeying the Navier-Stokes equation with Newtonian viscosity in the bulk of each phase. Capillary forces are taken into account even when interfaces merge or break up. Fluid interfaces are advanced in time using an exactly volume conserving variant of the volume of fluid algorithm, thus allowing for full symmetry between fluid phases. The Navier-Stokes equation is solved using staggered finite differences on a MAC grid and a split-explicit time differencing scheme, while incompressibility is enforced using an iterative multigrid Poisson solver. Capillary effects are represented as a stress tensor computed from gradients of the volume fraction function. This formulation is completely independent of the topology of interfaces and relatively easy to implement in 3D. It also allows exact momentum conservation in the discretized algorithm. Numerical spurious effects or "parasite currents" are noticed and compared to similar effects in Boltzmann lattice gas methods for immiscible fluids. Simulations of droplets pairs colliding in 2D and in 3D are shown. Interface reconnection is performed easily, despite the large value of capillary forces during reconnection.},

Strong laser fields can probe electrons in valence orbitals1-3 and their dynamics4-6 in the gas phase. Previous laser studies of solids have associated high-harmonic emission7-12 with the spatial arrangement of atoms in the crystal lattice13,14 and have used terahertz fields to probe interatomic potential forces15. Yet the direct, picometre-scale imaging of valence electrons in solids has remained challenging. Here we show that intense optical fields interacting with crystalline solids could enable the imaging of valence electrons at the picometre scale. An intense laser field with a strength that is comparable to the fields keeping the valence electrons bound in crystals can induce quasi-free electron motion. The harmonics of the laser field emerging from the nonlinear scattering of the valence electrons by the crystal potential contain the critical information that enables picometre-scale, real-space mapping of the valence electron structure. We used high harmonics to reconstruct images of the valence potential and electron density in crystalline magnesium fluoride and calcium fluoride with a spatial resolution of about 26 picometres. Picometre-scale imaging of valence electrons could~enable direct probing of the chemical, electronic, optical and topological properties of materials.},

  abstract = {Powder bed based additive manufacturing technologies allow for the production of more complex parts with overall better characteristics and are therefore of high industrial interest. However, due to an incomplete understanding of the multi-physic processes involved there are still some issues to be addressed. More specifically, in this work we will focus on the powder spreading stage. In powder bed-based technologies a thin layer of powder is deposited by a recoating device and is then processed by an energy source to obtain a layer of the final part. We use a numerical model based on the Discrete Element Method to reproduce the spreading process and propose an experimental analysis procedure to obtain data suitable for the validation of such numerical model. The experiments are carried out on a purposely designed device and both computations and experiment are referred to a single layer deposition. Being able to validate the numerical results can give way to a more confident use of DEM based models for the optimization of the spreading process and therefore improve the quality of printed parts.

  abstract = {The AlCoCrFeNi2.1 eutectic high-entropy alloy (EHEA) was prepared by selective laser melting (SLM), focusing on the anisotropy of microstructure and mechanical performance. The AlCoCrFeNi2.1 EHEA printed by SLM has face-centered cubic (FCC) and body-centered cubic (BCC)/B2 phases, and the FCC phase accumulates at the boundary of the molten pool. With the increase in volumetric energy density (VED), the content of the FCC phase parallel to the surface in the direction of the building increases from 30.9\% to 41\%. The X\textendash Z plane mainly produces columnar crystals along the temperature gradient, while a large number of equiaxed crystals are produced in the X\textendash Y direction. When the volume energy density is 157 kJ/mol (VED 157), the average grain size is 1.33 {$\mu$}m for BCC and 1.14 {$\mu$}m for FCC, which is significantly smaller than other preparation methods. Due to defect distribution and size, the microhardness of the X\textendash Y plane is generally higher than that of the X\textendash Z plane, with maximum hardnesses of 660 HV and 655 HV, respectively, which is much higher than those of traditionally manufactured counterparts. The compression performance of SLM process AlCoCrFeNi2.1 EHEAs shows maximum yield strength of 1567 MPa, and the ultimate compressive strength can reach 3276 MPa.},

  abstract = {Laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) is an additive manufacturing (AM) process in which a high power laser melts metal powder layers into complex, three-dimensional shapes. LPBF parts are known to exhibit relatively high residual stresses, anisotropic microstructure, and a variety of defects. To mitigate these issues, in-situ measurements of the melt-pool phenomena may illustrate relationships between part quality and process signatures. However, phenomena such as spatter, plume formation, laser modulation, and melt-pool oscillations may require data acquisition rates exceeding 10 kHz. This hinders use of relatively data-intensive, streaming imaging sensors in a real-time monitoring and feedback control system. Single-point sensors such as photodiodes provide the temporal bandwidth to capture process signatures, while providing little spatial information.     {$<$}/p{$>$}This paper presents results from experiments conducted on a commercial LPBF machine which incorporated synchronized, in-situ acquisition of a thermal camera, high-speed visible camera, photodiode, and laser modulation signal during fabrication of a nickel alloy 625 AM part with an overhang geometry. Data from the thermal camera provides temperature information, the visible camera provides observation of spatter, and the photodiode signal provides high temporal bandwidth relative brightness stemming from the melt pool region. In addition, joint-time frequency analysis (JTFA) was performed on the photodiode signal. JTFA results indicate what digital filtering and signal processing are required to highlight particular signatures. Image fusion of the synchronized data obtained over multiple build layers allows visual comparison between the photodiode signal and relating phenomena observed in the imaging detectors.},

  abstract = {Melt pool monitoring (MPM) is a technique used in laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) to extract features from in-situ sensor signals that correlate to defect formation or general part fabrication quality. Various melt pool phenomena have been shown to relate to measured transient absorption of the laser energy, which in turn, can be relatable to the melt pool emission measured in MPM systems. This paper describes use of a reflectometer-based instrument to measure the dynamic laser energy absorption during single-line laser scans. Scans are conducted on bare metal and single powder layer of nickel alloy 625 (IN625) at a range of laser powers. In addition, a photodetector aligned co-axially with the laser, often found in commercial LPBF monitoring systems, synchronously measured of the incandescent emission from the melt pool with the dynamic laser absorption. Relationships between the dynamic laser absorption, co-axial MPM, and surface features on the tracks are observed, providing illustration of the melt pool dynamics that formed these features. Time-integrated measurements of laser absorption are shown to correlate well with MPM signal, as well as indicate the transition between conduction and keyhole mode. This transition is corroborated by metallographic cross-section measurement, as well as topographic measurements of the solidified tracks. Ultimately, this paper exemplifies the utility of dynamic laser absorption measurements to inform both the physical nature of the melt pool dynamics, as well as interpretation of process monitoring signals.},

  abstract = {A hemispherical bubble, attached to a plate, is surrounded by an initially quiescent and isothermal liquid. By suddenly heating the plate, a thermal gradient over the bubble surface results. Because surface tension is temperature dependent, tangential stresses arise at the bubble surface. The liquid is viscous, and motion in the liquid phase begins. Such motion is an example of thermocapillary flow. This problem, besides being of interest from a fundamental point of view, is of possible concern in the design of space vehicles capable of storing cryogenic fluids for long periods of time in a weightless condition. Solutions to the problem are developed by numerical treatment of the governing equations. Flow and temperature fields, which depend upon the Prandtl and Marangoni numbers, were obtained for Prandtl numbers 1 and 5 and Marangoni numbers from 0 to 100,000. Results show that liquid is pulled toward the intersection of the bubble and the plate, then flows around the bubble surface, and leaves the bubble as a jet. The extent of the jet increases with increasing Marangoni number and decreases with increasing Prandtl number. Thermocapillary flow increases heat transfer (Nusselt number) over that obtained from conduction, but the increase is modest. The Nusselt number increases with the Marangoni number and is insensitive to the Prandtl number. At a Marangoni number of 40,000, the local Nusselt number was increased by a factor of 2. In order for thermocapillary flow to become a dominant heat transfer mechanism, the Marangoni number must exceed 100,000.},

  abstract = {Highly complex data streams from in-situ additive manufacturing (AM) monitoring systems are becoming increasingly prevalent, yet finding physically actionable patterns remains a key challenge. Recent AM literature utilising machine learning methods tend to make predictions about flaws or porosity without considering the dynamical nature of the process. This leads to increases in false detections as useful information about the signal is lost. This study takes a different approach and investigates learning a physical model of the laser powder bed fusion process dynamics. In addition, deep representation learning enables this to be achieved directly from high speed videos. This representation is combined with a predictive state space model which is learned in a semi-supervised manner, requiring only the optimal laser parameter to be characterised. The model, referred to as FlawNet, was exploited to measure offsets between predicted and observed states resulting in a highly robust metric, known as the dynamic signature. This feature also correlated strongly with a global material quality metric, namely porosity. The model achieved state-of-the-art results with a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) area under curve (AUC) of 0.999 when differentiating between optimal and unstable laser parameters. Furthermore, there was a demonstrated potential to detect changes in ultra-dense, 0.1\% porosity, materials with an ROC AUC of 0.944, suggesting an ability to detect anomalous events prior to the onset of significant material degradation. The method has merit for the purposes of detecting out of process distributions, while maintaining data efficiency. Subsequently, the generality of the methodology would suggest the solution is applicable to different laser processing systems and can potentially be adapted to a number of different sensing modalities.},

The residual N found in N2-atomized 17-4 powder feedstock is inherited by the additively produced material, and has dramatic effects on phase stability, microstructure, and microstructural evolution. Nitrogen is a known austenite stabilizing element, and the as-built microstructure of AM 17-4 can contain up to 90 pct or more retained austenite, compared to the nearly 100 pct martensite structure of wrought 17-4. Even after homogenization and solutionization heat treatments, AM 17-4 contains 5 to 20 pct retained austenite. In contrast, AM 15-5 and Ar-atomized AM 17-4 contain {$<$} 5 pct retained austenite in the as-built condition, and this level is further decreased following post-build thermal processing. Computational thermodynamics-based calculations qualitatively describe the observed depression in the martensite start temperature and martensite stability as a function of N-content, but require further refinements to become quantitative. A significant increase in the volume fraction of fine-scale carbide precipitates attributed to the high N-content of AM 17-4 is also hypothesized to give rise to additional activation barriers for the dislocation motion required for martensite nucleation and subsequent growth. An increase in the volume fraction of carbide/nitride precipitates is observed in AM 15-5, although they do not inhibit martensite formation to the extent observed in AM 17-4.},

Prior to specimen evaluation, various industry standard and non-standard heat treatments were performed. The focus of this thermal processing was to evaluate the effect of aging on mechanical performance with or without a prior solution heat treatment. Volumetric fraction of metastable austenite was measured to vary with heat treatments performed and the initial conditions from which aging was initiated. Material aged following a solution heat treatment was found to have an austenite reversion from a fully martensitic structure to volumetric fractions as high as 20.4\%. Whereas, initial concentrations of retained austenite in SLM as-fabricated material increased following a peak-age heat treatment, but decreased with higher temperature, overaged heat treatments. Specimens with large amounts of austenite demonstrated stress-induced transformation to martensite during tensile testing. This behavior was reflected in substantially reduced yield strengths, increased work hardening rates across greater ranges of strain, and delayed onset of localized plastic deformation. Ultimate tensile strengths for varieties of specimens aged to the peak-aged condition were similar, but differed greatly at strain levels where this strength was achieved.}

The simulation model was achieved by incorporating Fresnel reflections in the laser beam through the ray-tracing model. The CFD model was employed to investigate different overhanging situations, including perpendicular and parallel overhanging melt tracks on a cuboid block, as well as parallel melt tracks on an inclined block. The process parameters are found to strongly affect the surface morphologies of the overhanging melt track where voids caused by interfacial instability and geometrical defects namely discontinuities were observed. The subsequent defects caused by the discontinuity have also been investigated in both simulation and experiment. In the range of this study, it found that high laser power alleviates the discontinuity phenomenon of the overhanging melt track. However, by applying high laser power at high energy density, the high value of melt pool depth was formed, causing warpage to the overhanging printed part. Nevertheless, employing high laser power while maintaining low energy density can eliminate phenomenon such as irregular pores, partially-melted powder, deep melt pool formation and geometrical inaccuracy.},

The problem is formulated using the heat transfer equation considering the phase transition and the degree of consolidation based on the phase-field approach. The single-track scans of 316\,L stainless steel for both the non-powder case and the powder case are simulated to validate the model and the obtained results are in good agreement with the experimentally measured melt pool dimensions (mean error within 6\%). Furthermore, the melting modes (conduction and keyhole) can be distinguished based on the predicted melt pool morphology and the degree of vaporization with the proposed model, which provides insight to define the optimized process boundary. It is also found that the keyhole mode melting is more sensitive to the change of the process parameter than the conduction mode melting.},

The proposed methodology explores the use of the Streamline Upwind Petrov\textendash Galerkin (SUPG) stabilisation methodology as an alternative to the Jameson\textendash Schmidt\textendash Turkel (JST) stabilisation recently presented by the authors in Lee et~al. (2016) in the context of a conservation law formulation of fast solid dynamics. The work introduced in this paper puts forward three advantageous features over the recent JST-SPH framework. First, the variationally consistent nature of the SUPG stabilisation allows for the introduction of a locally preserving angular momentum procedure which can be solved in a monolithic manner in conjunction with the rest of the system equations. This differs from the JST-SPH framework, where an a posteriori projection procedure was required to ensure global angular momentum preservation. Second, evaluation of expensive harmonic and bi-harmonic operators, necessary for the JST stabilisation, is circumvented in the new SUPG-SPH framework. Third, the SUPG-SPH framework is more accurate (for the same number of degrees of freedom) than its JST-SPH counterpart and its accuracy is comparable to that of the robust (but computationally more demanding) Petrov\textendash Galerkin Finite Element Method (PG-FEM) technique explored by the authors in Lee et~al. (2014), Gil et~al. (2014,2016), Bonet et~al. (2015), as shown in the numerical examples included. A series of numerical examples are analysed in order to benchmark and assess the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. The resulting SUPG-SPH framework is therefore accurate, robust and computationally efficient, three key desired features that will allow the authors in forthcoming publications to explore its applicability in large scale simulations.},

  abstract = {Powder bed fusion (PBF) methods offer the best material properties among metal additive manufacturing (AM) processes. Yet, alloy development for PBF is only at its infancy and has a great untapped potential. This originates from the high solidification rate within the melt pool and to exploit the full potential of materials produced by PBF methods, a diligent work lies ahead. This paper presents a high-throughput method to rapidly screen large compositional alloy intervals experimentally for their PBF feasibility, which can drastically reduce the time needed for alloy development and provide valuable data for modelling. Our method consists of two steps; co-sputtering and electron beam re-melting. First step produces an alloy gradient film on a sheet substrate. The film is then re-molted to produce a PBF mimicked microstructure. The method is successfully demonstrated on binary systems; Al -Ti, -Zr and -Nb and produced gradients in compositional ranges of 3\textendash 50~wt\%Ti, 1\textendash 15~wt\%Zr and 2\textendash 15~wt\%Nb over a length of 200~mm. From the produced materials, the alloying efficiency could be investigated and determined regarding hardness and grain refinement. Zr shows the highest strength contribution per at\% and the best grain refinement at low levels. However, at higher levels grain refinement efficiency decreases for Zr.},

  abstract = {A three-dimensional numerical model is developed to investigate the melting and solidification process during the Selective Laser Melting (SLM) of IN718. The model utilizes the effective medium approach to solve the heat transfer and melt-flow dynamics within the melt-pool in a computationally efficient manner. In addition, the model replaces the built-in linear solidification function in commercial code ANSYS Fluent with a self-written non-linear solidification function in order to better describe the melt-pool formation during the SLM process. The simulation results obtained for the depth and width of the melt-pool are compared with the experimental data reported in the literature. Moreover, the simulated melt-pool length defined by the liquid-solid phase transition point of the melt-pool trailing edge is compared with the experimental observations obtained using a self-built in-situ inspection system. For the simulated melt-pool depth and width, no significant difference is found between the non-linear and linear models for the solidification behavior of IN718. However, the non-linear model provides a better prediction of the melt-pool length than the linear solidification function. Many studies have shown that the solid-liquid transition in the melting range of the material during cooling plays an important role in determining both the melt-pool length and the cooling rate of the SLM parts. As a result, the effects of the non-linear solidification behavior of IN718 are important not only in determining the melt-pool formation, but also in governing the liquid-solid transition process at the melt-pool tailing edge, which is one of the most important factors affecting the microstructure and residual stress accumulation of SLM printed parts.},

The application of meta-crystal approach to crystalline alloys provides exciting opportunities for high strength structural components. This study investigated the mechanical behaviour of polycrystal-like meta-crystals fabricated from a widely used alloy, Ti6Al4V, by laser powder bed fusion (LPBF). The use of Ti6Al4V in fabricating meta-crystals created materials containing hierarchical lattice structures across length-scales: the atomic lattice, the intrinsic crystalline microstructure, and the architected polycrystal-like mesostructure, with each hierarchical feature playing an influential role in the mechanical behaviour of meta-crystals. This present study examined the hierarchical lattice structures at different lengthscales and their contribution to the behaviour of meta-crystals. In particular, the presence of acicular {$\alpha$}' martensitic microstructure was responsible for low ductility in the as-printed meta-crystals. Although heat-treatment was able to transform the martensitic microstructure to a typical {$\alpha$}+{$\beta$} microstructure thus increasing the ductility, it was found that notch-like defects from lack of fusion at the free surface of struts were significantly detrimental. The study subsequently altered the meso-structural parameters to reduce the influence of the process defects and explored the effects of the heat treatment on the altered meta-crystals. Such alternations of structural design and crystalline microstructure appeared to be successful in minimising the processing effect, enabling the crystal-mimicry approach to effectively improve the toughness of Ti6Al4V meta-crystals.},

The polymer flow is treated as a single-phase flow with a free surface. This method reduces the computation time without loss of accuracy as polymer behavior significantly dominates air behavior. The governing equations of the fluid motion are solved with the finite element method on moving mesh, whereas the free surface is captured based on the level set method on another fixed mesh. Since the free surface is captured ``implicitly'' by the zero level of the level set function, coalescence between filaments is well defined and naturally performed. Numerical algorithm and implementation method are described in detail. This model provides detailed information on the cooling process and the bonding formation during the molten polymer deposition process. The effects of control parameters (nozzle velocity, flow rate and extrusion temperature, etc.) on the final deformed shapes of the printed parts are investigated. And finally, the numerical result from 2D simulations is compared to optical micro-graphs of the longitudinal cross-section of the printed sample, which shows good agreement between numerical and experimental results.},

  abstract = {Powder bed defects are irregularities in the powder layer, which alter the energy input during the powder bed fusion process. As a result, they are directly responsible for the formation of flaws in the consolidated material, which cause quality and property variability in additive manufactured parts. Because of their small size and ubiquity across the powder bed, powder bed defects are difficult to detect and correct. In this work, we propose a new method to assess powder bed defects across the entire powder bed at the remarkable spatial resolution of \textasciitilde 5 {$\mu$}m. Our method relies on the integration of a contact image sensor taken from a flatbed document scanner to the powder re-coater module. Owing to the narrow depth-of-field of the sensor, we detect powder bed defects by identifying out-of-focus regions in the acquired scans using numerical image analysis techniques. Moreover, we show that we can assess the defects height (or depth) by quantifying the degree of ``blurriness'' in such regions. Our ``powder bed scanner'' is a rapid and cost-effective tool for in-line characterization of the powder bed quality. This technology may be instrumental to develop novel close loop strategies aimed at improving the consistency of additive manufactured parts.},

In this work, a novel nano-oxides dispersion strengthened Co28Cr9W1.5Si (wt.\%) alloy, fabricated by laser powder bed fusion (LPBF), was comprehensively investigated. During the layer-by-layer featured process, in-situ formation of Si rich, amorphous, nano-oxide inclusions was observed, whose formation is ascribed to the high affinity of Si to oxygen. Meanwhile, distinctive body-centered cubic (BCC) Co5Cr3Si2 nano-precipitates with an 8-fold symmetry were also confirmed to appear. The precipitates, rarely reported in previous studied Co-Cr alloys, were found to tightly bond with the in-situ oxidization. Furthermore, the morphologies, the size distributions as well as the microstructure of the interface between the matrix and the inclusions were investigated in detail and their influence on the tensile deformation was also clarified. The existence of transition boundaries between these inclusions and the matrix strongly blocked the movement of dislocations, thereby increasing the strength of the alloy. It was understood that when the plastic deformation proceeds, the fracture occurs in the vicinity of the oxide inclusions where dislocations accumulate. A quantitative analysis of the strengthening mechanism was also established, in which an additional important contribution to strength ({$\sim$} 169 MPa) caused by the effects of in-situ formed oxide inclusions was calculated.},

However, it is very time-consuming since too many layers need to be simulated in a large component. In this paper, an enhanced layer lumping method (ELLM) is developed to accelerate the layer-wise simulation while maintaining its accuracy. Based on meso-scale modeling, material property parameters including yield stress and inherent strain values are adjusted for the lumped layers to avoid overestimation errors in the residual stress and deformation introduced by layer lumping. The material property adjustment incorporated in layer lumping is the key feature of the proposed ELLM. Computational time can be greatly reduced (e.g., 70\% decrease for the cantilever beam case) by the ELLM. Good accuracy for residual deformation prediction by the ELLM has been demonstrated by comparing a benchmark layer-wise simulation with experiment for a large Inconel 718 cantilever beam. Moreover, the scalability and robustness of the proposed method is also fully verified through a complex canonical part.},

While online control of 2D melt pool size has been successfully achieved, controlling the melt pool depth, which cannot be directly monitored during the process, is still an outstanding issue. In this study, a simulation-guided process design framework is developed which enables the possibility of defining a time-series laser power profile that achieves a desired melt pool depth across an arbitrary geometry using just one simulation. This is accomplished by implementing a proportional-integral controller in a thermal finite element simulation that utilizes the laser power to control the melt pool depth. The resulting laser power profile from the simulation can then be used in a real deposition process. Example cases with uniform and site-specific melt pool depth control using the developed method are presented. The results show that melt pool depth can be successfully controlled within the simulation and the developed method can be used to design a laser power profile which can be implemented in an arbitrary part to enhance geometric accuracy and control material properties within a part.},

In deep learning, neural network can deal with high-dimensional problems by adding the number of layers or expanding the number of neurons. Compared with traditional numerical methods, it has great advantages. In this article, we consider the Deep Galerkin Method (DGM) for solving the general Stokes equations by using deep neural network without generating mesh grid. The DGM can reduce the computational complexity and achieve the competitive results. Here, depending on the L2 error we construct the objective function to control the performance of the approximation solution. Then, we prove the convergence of the objective function and the convergence of the neural network to the exact solution.

  abstract = {With the increasing application of additive manufacturing (AM) in the industry, more attention has been paid to the performance of the additively manufactured part. How to maximize the structural efficiency of a part to achieve the desired performance has become the focus and challenge of design for additive manufacturing (DFAM). To give full play to the complex-geometry, multi-material, multi-scale, and multi-function manufacturing capabilities of AM, new approaches in DFAM have to be explored. The relationship between stress and growth in biology indicates that naturally evolved perfect structures are all optimal responses to their applied force. This work discusses a novel method to DFAM at the macroscale, mesoscale and microscale from a force-flow perspective, aiming to achieve an organic integration of force-flow based design with AM-driven manufacturing. Firstly, the characteristics of force-flow and its embodiment in nature and engineering are analyzed. Then, an overview of topology optimization, lattice/cellular structure design and infill pattern design are respectively provided in the combination of force-flow and AM. Finally, the future development directions of DFAM based on force-flow are proposed according to the limitations of current research.},

  abstract = {The advent of additive manufacturing (AM) offers the possibility of creating high-performance metallic materials with unique microstructure. Ultrafine dislocation cell structure in AM metals is believed to play a critical role in strengthening and hardening. However, its behavior is typically considered to be associated with alloying elements. Here we report that dislocations in AM metallic materials are self-stabilized even without the alloying effect. The heating\textendash cooling cycles that are inherent to laser power-bed-fusion processes can stabilize dislocation network in situ by forming Lomer locks and a complex dislocation network. This unique dislocation assembly blocks and accumulates dislocations for strengthening and steady strain hardening, thereby rendering better material strength but several folds improvements in uniform tensile elongation compared to those made by traditional methods. The principles of dislocation manipulation and self-assembly are applicable to metals/alloys obtained by conventional routes in turn, through a simple post-cyclic deformation processing that mimics the micromechanics of AM. This work demonstrates the capability of AM to locally tune dislocation structures and achieve high-performance metallic materials.},

  abstract = {The classical development of neural networks has primarily focused on learning mappings between finite-dimensional Euclidean spaces. Recently, this has been generalized to neural operators that learn mappings between function spaces. For partial differential equations (PDEs), neural operators directly learn the mapping from any functional parametric dependence to the solution. Thus, they learn an entire family of PDEs, in contrast to classical methods which solve one instance of the equation. In this work, we formulate a new neural operator by parameterizing the integral kernel directly in Fourier space, allowing for an expressive and efficient architecture. We perform experiments on Burgers' equation, Darcy flow, and Navier-Stokes equation. The Fourier neural operator is the first ML-based method to successfully model turbulent flows with zero-shot super-resolution. It is up to three orders of magnitude faster compared to traditional PDE solvers. Additionally, it achieves superior accuracy compared to previous learning-based solvers under fixed resolution.},

  abstract = {Materials are a vitally important issue in the development of human society, and the development of each new material could provide great support for scientific and technological progress and human development. Also, from the perspective of human development in the field of metal materials, the complexity of the elemental composition in alloys has been increasing steadily with time as illustrated, meanwhile the mixing entropy of the alloy system has also been improved, such as the super alloys and stainless steels, which are already in the range of medium-entropy alloys from the perspective of entropy value (1.0R {$\leq$} {$\Delta$}Smix {$<$} 1.5R) (R is the ideal gas constant) (Zhang et al., Sci China Mater 61: 2\textendash 22, 2018, Yan et al. Metall Mater Trans A 52: 2111\textendash 2122, 2021). The concept of high-entropy alloys (HEAs) was proposed by Professor Yeh in 2004 (Yeh et al., Adv Eng Mater 6: 299\textendash 303, 2004), which broke the design criteria of traditional metallic materials and provided us with new design ideas and concepts for the development of new materials. After more than 15 years of research work on HEAs, many results have been obtained in this field of scientific exploration. The results of these endeavors have indicated that HEAs exhibit many desirable properties, such as high-temperature resistance, break the trade-off between strength and toughness, irradiation resistance, excellent low-temperature performance (low-stacking fault energy with face-centered cubic structure), which have also been discovered (Zhang et al., Prog Mater Sci 61: 1\textendash 93, 2014, Sci China Mater, 61: 2\textendash 22, 2018).

The ML models are trained with synthetic 3D point clouds with defects and then applied to detect defects in actual production. Using synthetic 3D point clouds rather than experimental data could save a huge amount of training time and costs associated with many prints for each design. Besides distance differences of individual points between source and target point clouds, this scheme uses a new concept called ``patch'' to capture macro-level information about nearby points for ML training and implementation. Numerical comparisons of prediction results on experimental data with different shapes showed that the proposed scheme outperformed the existing Z-difference method in the literature. Five ML methods (Bagging of Trees, Gradient Boosting, Random Forest, K-nearest Neighbors and Linear Supported Vector Machine) were compared under various conditions, such as different point cloud densities and defect sizes. Bagging and Random Forest were found the two best models regarding predictability; and the right patch size was found to be at 20. The proposed ML-based scheme is applicable to in-situ defect detection during additive manufacturing with the aid of a proper 3D data acquisition system.},

To enhance quality, in-situ monitoring for AM processes has drawn considerable attention from researchers. Although progress has been made for in-situ monitoring of the directed energy deposition (DED) process, there are still challenges that must be addressed to improve the manufacturing quality. To solve the problem of achieving both high resolution and step-wise evolution of full-field deformation during in-situ monitoring of AM, we propose the coherent gradient sensing (CGS) method for in-situ monitoring of the DED process in this study. A CGS system was designed to perform in-situ monitoring during the DED process. The real-time full-field deformation of a thick substrate was measured for the first time in the cladding process of a disc-shaped specimen, in which the deformation distribution characteristics at different locations were analyzed. During the first layer cladding process, the deformation evolution of the substrate can be divided into three bending stages: U-type, S-type, and transitional. Our results show a significant relationship between the boundary R of deformation distribution in the y-axis at different stages and the radius r of the disc-shaped specimen: R\,=\,3/5\,r, with R being the boundary of deformation distribution and r being the radius of the disc-shaped specimen. The experimental results reveal that the relationship between the in-situ deformation evolution of the substrate and the deposition track at different stages can be effectively monitored using a CGS system. Furthermore, the obtained results can offer useful reference for improving the quality of components that are repaired or remanufactured using DED technology.},

In this work, the effects of laser power, laser scanning speed, and hatch spacing on the microstructure and mechanical properties of a laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) fabricated thermal conductive aluminum alloy 6063 (AA6063) were studied. The relationship between processing parameters and metallurgical defects was investigated. The element distribution and misorientation between grains around the crack were characterized. The results revealed that the majority of cracks were parallel to the building direction. The crack density was suppressed by increasing the scanning speed. The orientated cracks lead to the anisotropy of mechanical properties. The strength and ductility of the vertical samples are both higher than those of the horizontal samples. After aging treatment, an ultimate tensile strength of 241~MPa, yield strength of 215~MPa, and elongation of 4.9\% were obtained in the vertical specimen of the LPBF processed AA6063. It was demonstrated that cracks tend to stretch along the high-angle grain boundaries because of the concentration of local thermal stress at the final stage of solidification. This work provides guidance for defects suppression and mechanical properties optimization in additively manufactured AA6063 and other aluminum alloys.},

  abstract = {Stationary welds of sodium nitrate (NaNO3, a high-Prandtl-number material) and gallium (Ga, a low-melting-point, low-Prandtl-number material) were made with a defocused CO2 laser beam to simulate the effect of Marangoni convection on the shape of arc weld pools without a surface-active agent. A Peclet number representing the ratio of (heat transport by convection)/(heat transport by conduction) was defined as Pe = LV/{$\alpha$}, where L is the pool surface radius, V the maximum outward surface velocity and {$\alpha$} the thermal diffusivity. The Ga and NaNO3 pools represented the low and high extremes of Pe, respectively, with commonly welded metals such as aluminum, steel and stainless steel falling in between. By going to these extremes, the effect of convection on the pool shape could be much more easily understood. For Ga, Pe was low because low V (weak Marangoni convection) and high {$\alpha$} promoted conduction down into the pool, and the resultant pool bottom was concave. For NaNO3, however, Pe became high easily because high V (strong Marangoni convection) and very low {$\alpha$} promoted outward convective heat transport, and the resultant pool bottom was shallow and flat. Reducing the beam diameter further increased V (even stronger Marangoni convection) and Pe. The fast outward surface flow turned and penetrated downward at the pool edge, resulting in a convex pool bottom. Both the flat and convex pool bottoms are a clear indication Marangoni convection dominated over gravity-induced buoyancy convection. It is proposed that, in the absence of both a surface-active agent and a significant electromagnetic force, the pool bottom convexity increases with increasing Pe. It was shown that, for a given material composition and welding process, the weld shape often reveals a good deal about the nature of weld pool convection.},

  abstract = {A transparent pool of NaNO3 (10 mm in diameter) was heated with a defocused CO2 laser beam to simulate Marangoni convection in arc weld pools without a surface-active agent. The flow patternswere revealed clearly by flow visualization with a laser light-cut technique, the surface temperature profiles were measured immediately below the pool surface, and a device for measuring the beam diameter was developed. The observed Marangoni convection was expected to resemble that in welding because the Marangoni number was close to those in welding. Two counterrotating cells were observed in the meridian plane of the pool. The maximum velocity was at the pool surface, the outward surface flow was much faster than the inward return flow and the centers of the cells were near the pool edge. These characteristics suggest Marangoni convection dominates in the pool over gravity-induced convection. Increasing the beam power (from 0.5 to 5.4 W) and reducing the beam diameter (from 5.9 to 1.5 mm) both made Marangoni convection stronger. The latter, however, had a significantly greater effect; the surface flow wasso much stronger asto make the return flow penetrate deeper into the pool. The results of physical simulation provided interesting insights for understanding the significant effect of Marangoni convection on the weld pool shape, as will be presented in a followup report.},

This technology is an inherently multiphysics problem, involving the simultaneous evolution of fluid flow, heat transfer, free surface, laser-material interaction and material phases including solid, liquid and gas. Multiphysics and multiphase models are typically used to understand the dominant physics driving AM processes through high fidelity simulations resolving the individual powders as they melt onto the substrate. However, these types of high fidelity models have not been applicable to modeling directed energy deposition (DED) process, where powders are delivered through the ambient vapor onto the substrate by a nozzle and subsequently fused. This paper presents a novel multiphase thermo-fluid formulation for modeling DED processes. A diffuse level set formulation coupled with the Navier\textendash Stokes, energy conservation and radiative transport equation allows us to model complex free surface, fluid flow, thermal and laser interaction evolution. In addition, our formulation enables us to resolve the vapor flow field and its effect on deposited material during AM processes. The accuracy of our proposed method is assessed by comparing with literature solutions and experimental benchmarks. Our proposed formulation is then used to model simple DED processes that enable us to visualize the entrainment of powder particles into the melt pool. This process elucidates the dominant physical forces that can drive powders into the melt pool as well as their effect on the melt pool evolution within DED processes.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a review of the progress of smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) towards high-order converged simulations. As a mesh-free Lagrangian method suitable for complex flows with interfaces and multiple phases, SPH has developed considerably in the past decade. While original applications were in astrophysics, early engineering applications showed the versatility and robustness of the method without emphasis on accuracy and convergence. The early method was of weakly compressible form resulting in noisy pressures due to spurious pressure waves. This was effectively removed in the incompressible (divergence-free) form which followed; since then the weakly compressible form has been advanced, reducing pressure noise. Now numerical convergence studies are standard. While the method is computationally demanding on conventional processors, it is well suited to parallel processing on massively parallel computing and graphics processing units. Applications are diverse and encompass wave\textendash structure interaction, geophysical flows due to landslides, nuclear sludge flows, welding, gearbox flows and many others. In the state of the art, convergence is typically between the first- and second-order theoretical limits. Recent advances are improving convergence to fourth order (and higher) and these will also be outlined. This can be necessary to resolve multi-scale aspects of turbulent flow.},

  abstract = {Additive manufacturing by laser-based powder bed fusion is a promising technique for bulk metallic glass production. But, reheating by deposition of subsequent layers may cause local crystallisation of the alloy. To investigate the crystalline phase evolution during laser scanning of a Zr-based metallic glass-forming alloy, a simulation strategy based on the finite element method and the classical nucleation theory has been developed and compared with experimental results from multiple laser remelting of a single-track. Multiple laser remelting of a single-track demonstrates the crystallisation behaviour by the influence of thermal history in the reheated material. Scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy reveals the crystalline phase evolution in the heat affected zone after each laser scan. A trend can be observed where repeated remelting results in an increased crystalline volume fraction with larger crystals in the heat affected zone, both in simulation and experiment. A gradient of cluster number density and mean radius can also be predicted by the model, with good correlation to the experiments. Prediction of crystallisation, as presented in this work, can be a useful tool to aid the development of process parameters during additive manufacturing for bulk metallic glass formation.},

  abstract = {The classical development of neural networks has been primarily for mappings between a finite-dimensional Euclidean space and a set of classes, or between two finite-dimensional Euclidean spaces. The purpose of this work is to generalize neural networks so that they can learn mappings between infinite-dimensional spaces (operators). The key innovation in our work is that a single set of network parameters, within a carefully designed network architecture, may be used to describe mappings between infinite-dimensional spaces and between different finite-dimensional approximations of those spaces. We formulate approximation of the infinite-dimensional mapping by composing nonlinear activation functions and a class of integral operators. The kernel integration is computed by message passing on graph networks. This approach has substantial practical consequences which we will illustrate in the context of mappings between input data to partial differential equations (PDEs) and their solutions. In this context, such learned networks can generalize among different approximation methods for the PDE (such as finite difference or finite element methods) and among approximations corresponding to different underlying levels of resolution and discretization. Experiments confirm that the proposed graph kernel network does have the desired properties and show competitive performance compared to the state of the art solvers.},

  abstract = {Grain refinement is effective in restraining hot tearing, reducing anisotropy, eliminating defects, improving processability, and enhancing the mechanical properties of high-strength aluminum components additively manufactured by laser powder bed fusion (LPBF). However, achieving the desired strength and ductility in LPBF-fabricated high-strength aluminum alloys post grain refinement is a predominant challenge. We have therefore designed and developed a novel hybrid grain refiner (solute/ceramic nanoparticles) which can effectively refine grains and enhance the mechanical properties of LPBF-fabricated high-strength aluminum alloys. Adding a Ti/TiN hybrid grain refiner to the LPBF-fabricated 7050 alloy can produce ultrafine grains with an average size of 775nm, resulting in an ultimate tensile strength and ductility of up to 408\textendash 618MPa and 13.2\textendash 8.8\%, respectively. These tensile properties are comparable to those of conventional wrought 7XXX alloys. During LPBF processing, the hybrid grain refiner exhibited interesting synergistic grain refinements and strengthening mechanisms between the solute and the ceramic nanoparticles. During solidification, not only in-situ particles formed by the chemical reaction of the solute in liquid Al and the externally added ceramic nanoparticles can act as the nuclei of {$\alpha$}-Al respectively, but also solute can inhibit the agglomeration of ceramic nanoparticles to promote their nucleation efficiency. Moreover, the strength can be further improved by doping the solute atoms at the ceramic nanoparticle/Al interface. The improvement in elongation benefited from the uniform dispersion of the various particles.},

The resulting alloy exhibited a high relative density (99.71\%) and excellent tensile properties (tensile strength~=~720~MPa; post-fracture elongation~=~31.85\%). Optimization has been more commonly based on volumetric energy density (VED), but the unreliability of this method has been evidenced by the large difference in relative densities achieved using the VED-based approach. The high strength of alloy samples was investigated based on structural characterization, and the formation mechanisms of various defects are discussed. There is no micro-segregation or secondary phase according to both theoretical calculations and experimental observation. The strengthening mechanism of SLM FeCoCrNi sample has been reported by quantitative analysis of dislocation strengthening and fine grain strengthening. It was found that the dislocation strengthening contributed more than fine grain strengthening to the increased yield strength in SLM. This deeper insight into the processing and the strengthening mechanisms is expected to contribute to improved mechanical properties of SLM products, thereby increasing the potential for industrial applications of SLM.},

However, the gas dynamics and its induced driving forces for the powder motions have not been well quantified. A numerical model is developed to investigate such powder-gas interactions. With a combination of computational fluid dynamics and particle tracking techniques, the model is capable of simulating the transient gas flow field surrounding the powder and the forces exerted on powder surfaces. The interaction between metal powders and a free jet is investigated with the current model. In the simulation results, the entrainment and the ejection motions of powders with respect to the free jet can be predicted. It is found that the driving forces of these motions are majorly contributed by the pressure differences in the gas flow surrounding the powder, and the powders can also interact with the jet to significantly alter the flow field. Quantities which are difficult to measure by experiments are quantified by the simulations, such as the velocity/pressure fields in the gas as well as the subjected forces and torques of powders. Such quantitative information provides insights to the mechanisms of the powder-gas interaction in laser powder bed fusion processes.}

However, such products typically have poor mechanical properties, which cannot be significantly improved by traditional processing means such as cold rolling or forming as these would be destructive to the fabricated shape. Here, deep cryogenic treatment (DCT) is proposed to be an easy and effective approach to enhance the mechanical performance at room temperature of the laser melting deposited CoCrFeMnNi high entropy alloy (HEA). DCT is found to induce large compressive residual stress and crystalline defects including dislocations, stacking faults, nanotwins and nanograins into the additively manufactured CoCrFeMnNi HEA. Nano-twinning plays a critical role in the strengthening, contributing 51.0\textendash 246.8~MPa to the DCT-processed CoCrFeMnNi HEA, while the compressive residual stress is thought to be responsible for the improved ductility by suppressing crack formation. The crystalline defects are evidently generated during the cryogenic soaking, which also result in the compressive residual stress upon reheating at the end of the DCT. The present work establishes DCT as an effective method to simultaneously enhance the strength and plasticity in alloys fabricated by additive manufacturing.},

Surface wetting helps the bonding between powder and substrate and the inter-particle fusion, whereas the balling effect forms large spheroidal beads around the laser beam and causes voids, discontinuities, and poor surface roughness during the printing process. To better understand the transient dynamics, a theoretical model with a simplified 2D configuration is developed to investigate the underlying fluid flow and heat transfer, phase transition, and interfacial instability along with the laser heating. We demonstrate that the degree of wetting and fast solidification counter-balance the balling effect, and the Rayleigh-Plateau flow instability plays an important role for cases with relatively low substrate wettability and high scanning rate.},

  abstract = {Machine learning methods have recently shown promise in solving partial differential equations (PDEs). They can be classified into two broad categories: approximating the solution function and learning the solution operator. The Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) is an example of the former while the Fourier neural operator (FNO) is an example of the latter. Both these approaches have shortcomings. The optimization in PINN is challenging and prone to failure, especially on multi-scale dynamic systems. FNO does not suffer from this optimization issue since it carries out supervised learning on a given dataset, but obtaining such data may be too expensive or infeasible. In this work, we propose the physics-informed neural operator (PINO), where we combine the operating-learning and function-optimization frameworks. This integrated approach improves convergence rates and accuracy over both PINN and FNO models. In the operator-learning phase, PINO learns the solution operator over multiple instances of the parametric PDE family. In the test-time optimization phase, PINO optimizes the pre-trained operator ansatz for the querying instance of the PDE. Experiments show PINO outperforms previous ML methods on many popular PDE families while retaining the extraordinary speed-up of FNO compared to solvers. In particular, PINO accurately solves challenging long temporal transient flows and Kolmogorov flows where other baseline ML methods fail to converge.},

We identify and quantify four characteristic modes of powder-gas interaction in LPBF. The motion of a powder is controlled by one or multiple interaction modes collectively. As revealed by simulations and confirmed by experiments, powders can merge into the molten pool from its rim, be ejected at different divergence angles (powder spattering), or dive into the molten pool to cause significant molten pool fluctuation.

With the recent emergence of additive manufacturing (AM) techniques, the fabrication of MPEAs with locally tailorable microstructures and excellent mechanical properties has become possible. Therefore, it is of paramount importance to understand the key aspects of the AM processes that influence the microstructural features of AM fabricated MPEAs including porosity, anisotropy, and heterogeneity, as well as the corresponding impact on the properties. As such, this review will first present the state-of-the-art in existing AM techniques to process MPEAs. This is followed by a discussion of the microstructural features, mechanisms of microstructural evolution, and the mechanical properties of the AM fabricated MPEAs. Finally, the current challenges and future research directions are summarized with the aim to promote the further development and implementation of AM for processing MPEAs for future industrial applications.},

An improved heat and mass transfer model was developed here to analyze thermal behavior, driving force, surface tension-driven flow and its correlation with dilution during L-DED of Co-based powders to a 38MnVS substrate. Thermal behavior was firstly studied for its fundamental influence on fluid flow and mass transfer. Next, the roles of capillary force and thermal capillary force were characterized using both the dimensional analysis and simulation methods, and the mechanism of surface tension-driven flow was also qualitatively investigated. Finally, flow characteristics inside the melt pool were studied in detail and their correlation with the dilution phenomenon was analyzed based on the multi-component mass transfer model. The temperature gradient was found to be much larger at the front of the melt pool, and it took about 200 ms for the melt pool to reach a quasi-steady condition. Moreover, sharp changes in the curvature of the solid/liquid boundary were observed. Surface tension was demonstrated as the main driver for fluid flow and resulted in centrally outward Marangoni flow. Capillary force contributes to the reduction of the curvature of the free surface, and thermal capillary force (Marangoni force) dominated the Marangoni convection. Alloy elements from the powders, such as Co and Ni, were added to the front part of the melt pool and mainly diluted at the upper side of the rear region near the symmetric plane of the melt pool. Fundamental results in this work provide a valuable understanding of the surface tension-driven flow and its correlation with concentration dilution during the additive manufacturing process.},

In this work, a three-phase model based on the volume of fluid (VOF) is employed to investigate the heat transfer and melt pool behaviour in LPBF. Surface tension, Marangoni effect and recoil pressure are implemented in the model, and heat adsorption, reflection and transmission are fully considered. The results show that the melt pool dimension and its shape are controlled by laser power and scanning speed. Metal powders at the bottom layers may be not fully melted, and for larger layer thickness of the powder bed, porosities caused by the trapped gas can form. The gas originated from bulk powders can dissolve, coalesce, and be squeezed in the melt pool. It is demonstrated that the model can capture the main features of powder melting and solidification in LPBF process.},

The relative density of WMoTaTi made by SLM (SLMed) reaches 95.8 {$\pm$} 1.4\%, and it consisted of dominant BCC phase and minor HCP phase. The slight precipitation of HCP Ti was driven due to the non-equilibrium solidification during ultra-rapid cooling by SLM. The microhardness of WMoTaTi via SLM is 617.2 {$\pm$} 4.1 HV, preferable to those fabricated by traditional manufacturing processes. The sound microhardness is resulted from the fine grain size and nano-sized HCP precipitates, which favour dislocation pinning and promote strength. This work demonstrates that SLMed WMoTaTi has sound mechanical properties while using the cost-affordable pre-alloyed powders by fluidisation.},

A practical and effective method for predicting molten pool geometry becomes necessary to optimize process conditions and upgrade printing quality. In this study, a novel analytical model predicting molten pool geometry of SLM is proposed. The key of the model is to establish a heat balance within the front part of the molten pool based on a few assumptions supported by previous experimental and simulation discoveries. Compared with previous analytical models, the new model considers the specific molten pool configuration under the mutual action of recoil pressure and flow of melted metal. Experiments and numerical simulations of single-track SLM are carried out to validate analytical calculations. The results show good consistency when the input energy density is in the medium range. Correlations between the analytical predicted molten pool geometry and the defect thresholds of the inadequate fusion and the keyhole transition are investigated. The potential of the analytical model to rapidly predict molten pool cross-section geometry and determining the process window is demonstrated as well.},

However, the lack of process robustness, stability and repeatability caused by the unsolved complex relationships between material properties, product design, process parameters, process signatures, post AM processes and product quality has significantly impeded its broad acceptance in the industry. To facilitate efficient implementation of advanced data analytics in metal AM, which would support the development of intelligent process monitoring, control and optimisation, this paper proposes a novel Digital Twin (DT)-enabled collaborative data management framework for metal AM systems, where a Cloud DT communicates with distributed Edge DTs in different product lifecycle stages. A metal AM product data model that contains a comprehensive list of specific product lifecycle data is developed to support the collaborative data management. The feasibility and advantages of the proposed framework are validated through the practical implementation in a distributed metal AM system developed in the project MANUELA. A representative application scenario of cloud-based and deep learning-enabled metal AM layer defect analysis is also presented. The proposed DT-enabled collaborative data management has shown great potential in enhancing fundamental understanding of metal AM processes, developing simulation and prediction models, reducing development times and costs, and improving product quality and production efficiency.},

Herein, a novel grain refiner composed of TiC nanoparticles and TiH2 powders was used to develop the microstructure of selective laser melted AA2024 aluminum alloy. Due to the heterogeneous nucleation of {$\alpha$}-Al promoted by the cooperation of TiH2 and TiC, the microstructure of the TiC\textendash TiH2/AA2024 composite converted from columnar grains with an average area of 729.0~{$\mu$}m2 into equiaxed grains with an average area of 3.4~{$\mu$}m2, and the morphology of the second phase changed from streamline to network-shaped. Moreover, cracks in the TiC\textendash TiH2/AA2024 composite were intrinsically eliminated because of grain refinement. Benefitting from elimination of columnar grains and inhibition of cracks as well as the combined effect of refinement strengthening and Orowan strengthening, the TiC\textendash TiH2/AA2024 composite exhibited excellent mechanical properties, the tensile strength and elongation of as-built samples rose from 240~{$\pm~$}10~MPa and 0.3~{$\pm~$}0.2\% in AA2024 alloy to 390~{$\pm~$}15~MPa and 12.0~{$\pm~$}0.5\% in TiC\textendash TiH2/AA2024 composite.

In this paper, Al2O3/GdAlO3/ZrO2 ternary eutectic ceramic was additively manufactured based on one-step melt-growth by laser directed energy deposition, and its thermal stability under high temperatures was studied. The results indicate that the as-solidified eutectic composite consists of ultrafine phases of {$\alpha$}-Al2O3, GdAlO3 and t-ZrO2, and presents an irregular eutectic morphology with amounts of terminations and branches. The 3D-printed eutectic ceramic exhibits a superior thermal stability that no mass variation and no phase transition occur even after annealed at 1500 \textdegree C for 200h. In addition, the submicron-scaled eutectic microstructure and the polished surface topography can maintain stability up to 1400 \textdegree C which is higher than 80\% of its melting point ({$>$}0.8 Tm). With further increasing the temperature, obvious microstructure coarsening, and surface holes formation occur, leading to the severely deterioration of the mechanical property. The hardness of the as-deposited eutectic ceramic rapidly decreases from 15.84 {$\pm$} 0.61GPa to 13.01 {$\pm$} 0.40GPa after 200h annealed at 1500 \textdegree C.

The objective of this study is to develop a manifold learning-based feature extraction method for process monitoring of additive manufacturing (AM) using online sensor data.

In the numerical simulation and real-world case studies, the proposed method demonstrates excellent performance in both prediction accuracy and computational efficiency.},

  abstract = {Metal additive manufacturing (AM) is a group of processes by which metal parts are built layer by layer from powder or wire feedstock with high-energy laser or electron beams. The most well-known metal AM processes include selective laser melting, electron beam melting, and direct energy deposition. Metal AM can significantly improve the manufacturability of products with complex geometries and heterogeneous materials. It has the potential to be widely applied in various industries including automotive, aerospace, biomedical, energy, and other high-value low-volume manufacturing environments. However, the lack of complete and reliable process-structure-property (PS-P) relationships for metal AM is still the bottleneck to produce defect-free, structurally sound, and reliable AM parts. There are several technical challenges in establishing the PS-P relationships for process design and optimization. First, there is a lack of fundamental understanding of the rapid solidification process during which microstructures are formed and the properties of solid parts are determined. Second, the curse of dimensionality in the process and structure design space leads to the lack of data to construct reliable P-S-P relationships. Simulation becomes an important tool to enable us to understand rapid solidification given the limitations of experimental techniques for in-situ measurement. In this research, a mesoscale multiphysics simulation model, called phase-field and thermal lattice Boltzmann method (PF-TLBM), is developed with simultaneous considerations of heterogeneous nucleation, solute transport, heat transfer, and phase transition. The simulation can reveal the complex dynamics of rapid solidification in the melt pool, such as the effects of latent heat and cooling rate on dendritic morphology and solute distribution. The microstructure evolution in the complex heating and cooling environment in the layer-by-layer AM process is simulated with the PF-TLBM model. To meet the lack-of-data challenge in constructing P-S-P relationships, a new scheme of multi-fidelity physics-constrained neural network (MF-PCNN) is developed to improve the efficiency of training in neural networks by reducing the required amount of training data and incorporating physical knowledge as constraints. Neural networks with two levels of fidelities are combined to improve prediction accuracy. Low-fidelity networks predict the general trend, whereas high-fidelity networks model local details and fluctuations. The developed MF-PCNN is applied to predict phase transition and dendritic growth. A new physics-constrained neural network with the minimax architecture (PCNN-MM) is also developed, where the training of PCNN-MM is formulated as a minimax problem. A novel training algorithm called Dual-Dimer method is developed to search high-order saddle points. The developed PCNN-MM is also extended to solve multiphysics problems. A new sequential training scheme is developed for PCNN-MMs to ensure the convergence in solving multiphysics problems. A new Dual-Dimer with compressive sampling (DD-CS) algorithm is also developed to alleviate the curse of dimensionality in searching high-order saddle points during the training. A surrogate model of process-structure relationship for AM is constructed based on the PF-TLBM and PCNN-MM. Based on the surrogate model, multi-objective Bayesian optimization is utilized to search the optimal initial temperature and cooling rate to obtain the desired dendritic area and microsegregation level. The developed PF-TLBM and PCNN-MM provide a systematic and efficient approach to construct P-S-P relationships for AM process design.}

Coupled with the extracted temperature profiles and heating/cooling rates, the competitive growth of {$\beta$} grains upon solidification of the molten pool is successfully predicted. The solid-state {$\beta\rightarrow\alpha$}/{$\alpha$}\textasciiacute{} transformation in the fusion zone and heat-affected zone is then captured by the kinetic solid-state phase prediction model. With the predicted volume fractions of {$\alpha$} and {$\alpha$}\textasciiacute{} in the final microstructure, the microhardness is assessed, matching the experimental measurements.},

  abstract = {316\,L stainless steel samples were built vertically (VB) and horizontally (HB) by selective pulsed laser melting. The microstructure of the as-fabricated samples was investigated using a range of characterisation techniques and the properties evaluated by tensile testing. It was found that at a relatively low laser power (200\,W) pores evolved from lack-of-fusion pores to keyhole pores with increased laser exposure time. Correspondingly, the porosity level decreased first and then increased with exposure duration. Increased laser power led to minimisation of porosity. The porosity type and level did not cause significant influence on tensile properties in the current case. With increased energy density, the microstructure changed from a fine dispersive fan-like grain structure gradually into a coarse vertically grown columnar grain structure, leading to increased {$<$}100{$>$} texture along the building direction. With the latter microstructure, the VB samples show much higher yield strength and ultimate tensile strength but lower elongation than their HB counterparts, leading to development of mechanical anisotropy. The mechanical anisotropy was strongly associated with grain movements through different dominant deformation mechanisms in different building directions, i.e., the VB samples deformed mainly by grain elongation via dislocation slipping whereas the HB samples deformed by grain rotation through massive twinning and slipping. With the refined fan-like grain structure, grain rotation was heavily involved in both HB and VB samples, which was beneficial for reduction in mechanical anisotropy. The extent of mechanical anisotropy decreased with decreased laser power and exposure time, paving the way for reducing mechanical anisotropy in this material.},

A powder packing model, including particle size distribution based on the discrete element method, was developed to describe the relative density variation of the powder bed with different layer thicknesses. A finite element method model with Gaussian laser beam was established to predict the dynamic thermal behavior and flow mechanism of the particles for a single-line scanning. The level-set method was used to trace the free surface of the molten metal with temperature-dependent surface tension. A function to describe the relative density of the powder bed with its thickness was obtained. An evaporation model considering the influence of mass, energy loss, and evaporation on the surface morphology of the molten pool was established. According to the temperature and velocity field in the molten pool, a vortex formed by the Marangoni effect might decrease the depth and increase the width of the molten pool. The molten pool was not disconnected by Plateau\textendash Rayleigh instability due to the small length/diameter ratio at low scanning speeds. The model assuming regularly arranged powder bed underestimates the maximum temperature as compared to the model considering a randomly packed powder bed because a higher relative density of the former facilitates heat conduction. The simulated results are consistent with experimental results, including porosity, material loss, and surface defects.},

The boundary condition is now inserted directly into the model as boundary term, and the model is a combination of a boundary term and a multilayer feedforward network with its weight function. As the boundary condition becomes predefined constraintion in the model itself, the neural network is trained as an unconstrained optimization problem. This leads to both ease of training and high accuracy. Due to universal convergency of multilayer feedforward networks, the new method is a general approach in solving different types of differential equations.

The semi-molten Nb particle phase was retained during LPBF, so that {$\beta$}-Nb and the eutectic structure display a gradient distribution in the Nb diffusion concentration. The heat treatment process (annealed at 850\,\textdegree C for 0.5\,h) makes NiTi\textendash Nb samples have high yield strength ({$\sim$}1640\,MPa), high compressive strength ({$\sim$}2380\,MPa), and high compressive strain ({$\sim$}39\%), which are superior to the corresponding ones of its as-built and as-cast counterparts.

Overall, the presence of {$\beta$}-Nb phase has a beneficial effect on the alloy, and a large number of intertwined dislocations and stacking faults around the {$\beta$}-Nb phase promote the formation of martensite under stress loading.

The variations introduce the potential for defects that lead to part failure, some of which are difficult to identify non-destructively with common ex-situ evaluation techniques. These defects include significant microstructural and mechanical property differences in the part interiors. In this paper, thermal features are extracted from in-situ Short-Wave Infrared (SWIR) imaging measurements to compile voxel based part representations and understand how the complexities in the thermal history affect part performance. The deviations in thermal features due to different laser processing parameters and complex scan pathing are explored. Empirical correlations are developed to map thermal features with the engineering properties (bulk yield strength, area percentage porosity, and local state) of 304\,L stainless steel parts manufactured by LPBF. Processing modes (insufficient melting and keyholing) are determined by mapping part property measurements with multiple thermal features. Generating the relationships between thermographic measurements and resulting SLM part properties lays the foundation for in-situ part qualification.},

The nature of SLM permits in-situ monitoring of radiometric signals emitted from the part surface during the process, including optical emission from excited alloying elements. Using Optical Emission Spectroscopy (OES) to measure the spectral content of light emitted gives insight into the chemistry and relative intensities of excited species vaporized during SLM processing. The contribution from investigating the use of in-situ OES to gain information about local processing conditions during SLM is reported in this paper. A spectrometer is split into the SLM system laser beam path to measure visible light emitted from the melt pool and plume during the processing of 304L stainless steel. The in-line configuration allows signal collection regardless of the laser scan location. The spectroscopic information is correlated to the melt pool size and features of SLM samples for various build conditions (i.e., process parameters, build chamber atmosphere type, and pressure).The limitations that exist in OES implementation for certain build chamber conditions are discussed. The results in this paper are initial progress towards the use of OES in SLM part qualification and controls applications.}

The difficulties associated with non-linear terms for model reduction are tackled by designing an adaptive reduced integration domain. The proposed online basis adaptation strategy is based on a combination of a basis mapping, enrichment by local residuals and a gappy basis reconstruction technique. The efficiency of the proposed method will be demonstrated by representative 3D examples of additive manufacturing models, including single-track and multi-track cases.},

Herein, we investigate the performance of two neural operators, and we develop new practical extensions that will make them more accurate and robust and importantly more suitable for industrial-complexity applications. The first neural operator, DeepONet, was published in 2019, and the second one, named Fourier Neural Operator or FNO, was published in 2020. In order to compare FNO with DeepONet for realistic setups, we develop several extensions of FNO that can deal with complex geometric domains as well as mappings where the input and output function spaces are of different dimensions. We also endow DeepONet with special features that provide inductive bias and accelerate training, and we present a faster implementation of DeepONet with cost comparable to the computational cost of FNO. We consider 16 different benchmarks to demonstrate the relative performance of the two neural operators, including instability wave analysis in hypersonic boundary layers, prediction of the vorticity field of a flapping airfoil, porous media simulations in complex-geometry domains, etc. The performance of DeepONet and FNO is comparable for relatively simple settings, but for complex geometries and especially noisy data, the performance of FNO deteriorates greatly. For example, for the instability wave analysis with only 0.1\% noise added to the input data, the error of FNO increases 10000 times making it inappropriate for such important applications, while there is hardly any effect of such noise on the DeepONet. We also compare theoretically the two neural operators and obtain similar error estimates for DeepONet and FNO under the same regularity assumptions.},

This universal approximation theorem is suggestive of the potential application of neural networks in learning nonlinear operators from data. However, the theorem guarantees only a small approximation error for a sufficient large network, and does not consider the important optimization and generalization errors. To realize this theorem in practice, we propose deep operator networks (DeepONets) to learn operators accurately and efficiently from a relatively small dataset. A DeepONet consists of two sub-networks, one for encoding the input function at a fixed number of sensors \$x\_i, i=1,\textbackslash dots,m\$ (branch net), and another for encoding the locations for the output functions (trunk net). We perform systematic simulations for identifying two types of operators, i.e., dynamic systems and partial differential equations, and demonstrate that DeepONet significantly reduces the generalization error compared to the fully-connected networks. We also derive theoretically the dependence of the approximation error in terms of the number of sensors (where the input function is defined) as well as the input function type, and we verify the theorem with computational results. More importantly, we observe high-order error convergence in our computational tests, namely polynomial rates (from half order to fourth order) and even exponential convergence with respect to the training dataset size.},

Specifically, DeepXDE can solve forward problems given initial and boundary conditions, as well as inverse problems given some extra measurements. DeepXDE supports complex-geometry domains based on the technique of constructive solid geometry and enables the user code to be compact, resembling closely the mathematical formulation. We introduce the usage of DeepXDE and its customizability, and we also demonstrate the capability of PINNs and the user-friendliness of DeepXDE for five different examples.

  abstract = {It is challenging to simultaneously achieve nearly full density and high strength in refractory alloys using selective laser melting (SLM). In this study, the achievement of ultrahigh-strength resulting from nearly full density has been reported in beta-type titanium alloy by controlling the melt pool mode in SLM. The melt pool mode was divided into the conduction and keyhole modes, which were determined from the macroscopic morphology of the melt pool in the SLMed Ti-34.2Nb-6.8Zr-4.9Ta-2.3Si (wt.\%) (TNZTS) alloy single tracks in combination with the keyhole threshold (P{$\cdot$}V-0.5\,=\,251.3\,W\,(m\,s-1)-0.5) calculated theoretically. Compared with condition mode, the keyhole mode has higher porosity and inevitably causes poor mechanical property. Fortunately, by optimizing the SLM process parameters predicted via the keyhole threshold, an ultrahigh-strength and nearly full density (99.7\%) TNZTS alloy with conduction mode was obtained by SLM. The alloy exhibited an ultrahigh compressive yield strength of 1286\,MPa, which was higher than the majority of the beta-type titanium alloys reported so far. The microstructural analyses indicated that the ultrahigh-strength TNZTS alloy consisted of a thin shell-shaped (Ti, Nb, Zr)2Si (S2) phase (20\textendash 50\,nm) around the columnar {$\beta$}-Ti grain boundaries together with an ultrafine dot shaped (Ti, Nb, Zr)5Si3 (S1) phase (50\textendash 300\,nm) in the {$\beta$}-Ti matrix. The ultrahigh strength resulted from high-density dislocations and the effective dislocation blockage by the semi-coherent S1 and coherent S2 phases, thereby leading to the dislocation-strengthening and hardening effect. The strategy utilized in this study provides the fundamental guidelines for generating refractory metallic alloys with high density and excellent performance.},

  abstract = {Due to the high efficiency and low cost, gas atomization (GA) has been widely applied to produce metal powders. In this paper, the GA process is first modeled by combining the volume of fluid (VOF) model with dynamic adaptive mesh and the discrete phase model (DPM) to simulate the formation of the powders and the evolution of the defects. Simulation results show that the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability in the primary atomization and the membranous droplet breakup and closure in secondary atomization can form the hollow powder. While the presence of the satellite powder is caused by the collisions between the large and small droplets with different velocities. Moreover, the irregular powder is produced when the drag force is not enough to separate the droplets but deforms them. The estimated morphology and size distribution of the particles have a good agreement with the experimental ones. Finally, the possible measures to reduce the defects of the powders have been put forward based on the revealed mechanism of defect evolution. This work provides a deep simulation insight into the GA process, towards producing high-quality metal powders for additive manufacturing on a large scale.},

Introducing ductile Cu into Fe\textendash Co\textendash B\textendash Si\textendash Nb bulk metallic glass alloy system rich with Fe and Co could be a promising solution to reduce or even eliminate micro-cracks since there is almost no miscibility of Cu in Fe and Co. In this work, processing, microstructure and mechanical properties of Cu-containing \{(Fe0.6Co0.4)0.75B0.2Si0.05\}96Nb4 (at.\%) bulk metallic glass composites (BMGCs) under different laser power and scanning speed by LPBF are investigated in detail. A moderate area energy density facilitates the fabrication of highly dense (relative density: up to\,{$\sim$}\,99.5\%) and almost crack-free (crack density: {$\sim$}0.1\,mm-1) FeCoBSiNb\textendash Cu bulk samples. These bulk samples possess an interpenetrating composite microstructure mainly composed of an amorphous Fe(Co)-rich phase and a crystalline Cu-rich phase. A crystalline Cu-rich phase is distributed relatively homogeneously in an amorphous phase and helps to reduce and even eliminate micro-crack formation during LPBF processing. Also, the Cu-rich phase has the effect of a heat sink and thus speeds up heat dissipation, facilitating the formation of an amorphous phase. The microhardness of the ductile Cu-rich phase and the hard amorphous Fe(Co)-rich phase in the interpenetrating composite microstructure was evaluated. Compressive tests at room temperature indicate that the dense bulk samples exhibit a relatively high fracture strength and a large fracture strain. Additionally, bulk samples with lack-of-fusion pores show a larger fracture strain although their fracture strength is lower than that of dense bulk samples. It is concluded that the LPBF-processed FeCoBSiNb\textendash Cu BMGCs constitute a promising wear-resistant material to be used for example as bearing materials.},

However, its potential of industry applications is limited by the variability of build qualities. The microstructures of the build are influenced by thermal history and melt flow. To overcome the limitation of conventional sensing methods for measuring the temperature and velocity fields in the melt pool, a novel technique called physics based compressive sensing (PBCS) is proposed. Based on some temperature measurements on the top surface of melt pool and a multiphysics model, PBCS can recover and reconstruct the complete temperature and velocity fields in three dimensions. The PBCS results are validated with experimental data from traditional infrared thermal imaging and x-ray imaging. With the proposed PBCS, the cost-effectiveness of LPBF process monitoring can be significantly improved.},

The nano- and micro- hardness and the elastic modulus of the SLM-fabricated Cu50Zr43Al{$_7$} BMG were higher than CuZrAl ternary BMGs with similar compositions prepared by conventional mold casting, which can be attributed to the structural relaxation in the former sample. However, the macro compressive strength of the SLM-fabricated Cu50Zr43Al{$_7$} BMG was only 1044 MPa mainly due to its porosity.

On the other hand, 1.5\,wt.\% of Y2O3 addition was found to be excessive, as it led to a significantly thicker Laves phase and coarser grains.

In this study, a transient mesoscale model with a packed powder-bed is proposed by a simulation to reveal the pore elimination mechanism during the laser re-melting process intuitively. The effect of the laser re-melting on the temperature distribution, molten pool dynamics and resultant surface morphology is investigated. The results show that the re-melting scanning speed played an essential role in controlling the elimination effect on pores. A higher re-melting scanning speed does not eliminate most of the pores due to the limited energy input. In contrast, a lower re-melting scanning speed introduces new types of pores caused by the unstable molten pool. At an appropriate re-melting scanning speed, most of the pores are eliminated attributing to the sufficient spreading of the molten material due to the drag force of melt flow and the escape of the entrapped gas driven by thermocapillary force. The density and surface quality are determined experimentally. The relative density after laser re-melting at a scanning speed of 300~mm/s is improved 99.2\% and the surface roughness reduced to Ra 1.9~{$\mu$}m. The simulation results can serve to provide guidance for parameter optimization and improve the density in high effectiveness and efficiency finally.},

We test the hypothesis that the spectral graph-based topological invariants detect incipient process drifts earlier [lower average run length (ARL1)] and with higher fidelity (consistency of detection) when compared with the conventional statistics-based approaches. The presented approach maps a multidimensional sensor data stream XN\texttimes d (visualize N as time and d as the number of sensors) as an unweighted and undirected network graph G(V, E), indexed by its vertices V and edges E, i.e., X \textrightarrow{} G(V, E). The rationale is that the graph-based topological invariants are surrogate representatives of the system state. We compare the monitoring performance of spectral graph theoretic invariants with conventional statistical features in an exponentially weighted moving average control chart setting. The practical utility of the approach is substantiated in the context of process monitoring in two advanced manufacturing scenarios, namely, ultraprecision machining (UPM) and semiconductor chemical mechanical planarization. These studies corroborate the hypothesis that graph theoretic invariants, when used as monitoring statistics, lead to lower ARL1 and more consistent detections in contrast to conventional statistical features. For instance, in the UPM case, the fault detection delay using graph theoretic invariants is less than 160 ms, compared with over 8 s of delay with statistical features.},

The approach is based on the Volume of Fluid (VOF) method with special focus on the numerical treatment of the temperature surface gradient because of its decisive role as the driving force of the flow. The surface gradient calculation is split into computing its length and direction in order to satisfy the correct thermal boundary condition at the interface without losing mobility of the interface. The method is applied to three different types of thermocapillary flow, namely thermocapillary migration of a droplet in an ambient fluid with linear temperature gradient, thermocapillary convection in a liquid layer under linear temperature gradient along the interface, and Marangoni convection due to B\'enard\textendash Marangoni instability. In the first case, different aspects of the dynamics of the migration are considered for validation such as the terminal migration velocity, the initial acceleration and quantification of the wall effects. The simulation also considers high convective heat transfer and covers a wide range of Marangoni numbers up to 5000, where good agreement with both theoretical and experimental results is achieved. In the second case, the convection velocity in the liquid layer is compared with an analytical result. In the final application, pattern formation due to the B\'enard\textendash Marangoni instability in a liquid layer in square geometry of small aspect ratio is investigated for realistic Biot number and dynamically deformable fluid interface. The results show good agreement with experiments from literature, where our numerical simulation also predicts cell pattern for a particular aspect ratio which is outside the limitation of the above cited experimental work.},

Gas tungsten arc welding (GTAW) provides the heat source for this new approach, combined with in-situ alloying through separate feeding of commercially pure Ti and Al wires into the weld pool. This paper investigates the morphology, microstructure and mechanical properties of the additively manufactured TiAl material, and how these are affected by the location within the manufactured component. The typical additively layer manufactured morphology exhibits epitaxial growth of columnar grains and several layer bands. The fabricated {$\gamma$}-TiAl based alloy consists of comparatively large {$\alpha$}2 grains in the near-substrate region, fully lamellar colonies with various sizes and interdendritic {$\gamma$} structure in the intermediate layer bands, followed by fine dendrites and interdendritic {$\gamma$} phases in the top region. Microhardness measurements and tensile testing results indicated relatively homogeneous mechanical characteristics throughout the deposited material. The exception to this homogeneity occurs in the near-substrate region immediately adjacent to the pure Ti substrate used in these experiments, where the alloying process is not as well controlled as in the higher regions. The tensile properties are also different for the vertical (build) direction and horizontal (travel) direction because of the differing microstructure in each direction. The microstructure variation and strengthening mechanisms resulting from the new manufacturing approach are analysed in detail. The results demonstrate the potential to produce full density titanium aluminide components directly using the new additive layer manufacturing method.},

In the present work, a self-designed, pre-alloyed Al-Cu-Ti-Ag-Mg alloy is processed using LPBF. The solidification path, which is necessary to achieve sufficient supercooling to exceed the critical nucleation supercooling ({$\Delta$}Tn) required for heterogeneous nucleation on L12 Al3Ti nuclei, is derived from the microstructure. This unique microstructure can be divided into two areas: Area 1, with a thickness in the building direction of 5\textendash 10\textmu m, solidifies first and forms on the bottom of the semicircular melting pool. It is dominated by columnar {$\alpha$}-Al grains, which contain numerous precipitated cube-shaped Al-Cu-Ti-Ag nanoparticles. During the solidification of Area 1, the constitutional supercooling ({$\Delta$}TCS) and the thermal supercooling ({$\Delta$}Ttherm) gradually increase. The Ti and Al atoms in the residual melt react to form numerous primary L12 Al3Ti particles, which are activated for heterogeneous nucleation and serve as nuclei for {$\alpha$}-Al grain growth once {$\Delta$}Ttotal ({$\Delta$}TCS + {$\Delta$}Ttherm) exceeds {$\Delta$}Tn. Area 2, formed by heterogeneous grain refinement, occupies the remaining part of the melting pool and consists of fine equiaxed {$\alpha$}-Al grains. The cube-shaped Al-Cu-Ti-Ag nanoparticles precipitated from the supersaturated {$\alpha$}-Al in Area 1 cannot be observed in Area 2. The novel alloy with a fine-grained microstructure exhibits a tensile strength of 475 {$\pm$} 7MPa in combination with an elongation to fracture of 8.7 {$\pm$} 0.5\%.},

  abstract = {Avoiding or eliminating thermal abnormalities in powder-bed fusion (PBF) is critical since the abnormalities can lead to a higher failure rate of printing complex parts, a longer manufacturing lead time, and/or additional post-processing. Controlling the thermal evolution of the process can hinder or minimize some of the most frequently encountered thermal abnormalities. To achieve such an objective, the prediction and control of temperature distribution throughout an exposure layer is a crucial step. The generation of uniform temperature distribution throughout the printed layers, as well as the avoidance of overheated zones, are two primary sub-objectives for controlling the thermal evolution of the process. However, the complex and non-linear nature of the process has limited the ability to derive a universal analytical equation to correlate the process parameters with the thermal distribution of a printed layer. Laser specifications such as laser power and scanning speed are amongst the main process parameters that predominantly govern the temperature distribution throughout the layer. In this paper, we employ an artificial neural network (ANN) to correlate laser power with the temperature of the printed area around the melt pool in Inconel 718. In our first variant, we investigate the effectiveness of using the multilayer perceptron Radial Basis Neural Network (RBNN) to model the function for predicting the temperature distribution for various laser power. We use the Rosenthal equation to generate adequate inputs-outputs for training our function. We then compare the output with the simulation results for five different laser powers. The results show that the function was trained successfully with a low mean square root error of 9.7157 using 2000 samples, a wider gap exists between the trained function and the simulated data. In the second variant, we use a recurrent neural network (RNN), which enables temporal histories to be used for training. To fulfill such objective, we acquire real thermal data using a photon-counting IR camera for different printed layers. This step allows the training of a function to predict the temperature distribution precisely for different laser power and thermal history. As future work, we will employ the function to adjust the laser power to minimize the overheated zones and distribute the temperature uniformly throughout each exposure layer.}

  abstract = {Laser powder bed fusion (LBPF) was employed to fabricate a strain-transformable {$\beta$}-Ti alloy, Ti-10V-2Fe-3Al (wt\%). While the alloy is known to exhibit transformation induced plasticity (TRIP), the as-fabricated alloy, under tensile loading, did not show the same TRIP effects, even though it exhibits the same {$\beta~$}+~{$\omega$} microstructure. The repeated heating-cooling cycles experienced during the LBPF process leads to the early stages of rejection of solute elements (Fe, V, and Al), forming isothermal omega ({$\omega$}) precipitates, which were captured via detailed investigations coupling transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and three-dimensional atom probe tomography (APT). While these homogeneously distributed isothermal {$\omega$} precipitates lead to a higher yield strength, the TRIP/TWIP effects within the {$\beta$} matrix were suppressed, leading to very low ductility and virtually no strain-hardenability. Interestingly, after a simple {$\beta$}-solution heat treatment followed by quenching, leading to a {$\beta~$}+~{$\omega$} (athermal) microstructure, the TRIP/TWIP effects were reactivated in the same LPBF Ti-10~V-2Fe-3Al alloy. The alloy exhibited substantial recovery of tensile ductility and a very large strain hardening (tensile strength minus yield strength \textasciitilde 500~MPa), with a high average strain hardening rate \textasciitilde 15000. Such a very high strain hardening rate in case of LBPF processed Ti-10~V-2Fe-3Al, appears to arise from a rapid strain-induced transformation from {$\beta$} to {$\alpha$}" at the early stages of plastic deformation, leading to a high-volume fraction of the martensitic phase, coupled with hierarchical twinning within the martensite plates.},

Thermal behaviors of laser power and scanning speed in the procedure of SLM AlSi25 powder were studied. With the increase of laser power, the maximum temperature, size and cooling rate of the molten pool increase, while the scanning speed decreases. For an expected SLM process, a perfect molten pool can be generated using process parameters of laser power of 180 W and a scanning speed of 200 mm/s. The pool is greater than the width of the scanning interval, the depth of the molten pool is close to scan powder layer thickness, the temperature of the molten pool is higher than the melting point temperature of the powder and the parameters of the width and depth are the highest. To confirm the accuracy of the simulation results of forecasting excellent process parameters, the SLM experiment of forming AlSi25 powder was carried out. The surface morphology of the printed sample is intact without holes and defects, and a satisfactory metallurgical bond between adjacent scanning channels and adjacent scanning layers was achieved. Therefore, the development of numerical simulation in this paper provides an effective method to obtain the best process parameters, which can be used as a choice to further improve SLM process parameters. In the future, metallographic technology can also be implemented to obtain the width-to-depth ratio of the SLM sample molten pool, enhancing the connection between experiment and theory.},

  abstract = {In high-speed flow past a normal shock, the fluid temperature rises rapidly triggering downstream chemical dissociation reactions. The chemical changes lead to appreciable changes in fluid properties, and these coupled multiphysics and the resulting multiscale dynamics are challenging to resolve numerically. Using conventional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) requires excessive computing cost. Here, we propose a totally new efficient approach, assuming that some sparse measurements of the state variables are available that can be seamlessly integrated in the simulation algorithm. We employ a special neural network for approximating nonlinear operators, the DeepONet, which is used to predict separately each individual field, given inputs from the rest of the fields of the coupled multiphysics system. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DeepONet by predicting five species in the non-equilibrium chemistry downstream of a normal shock at high Mach numbers as well as the velocity and temperature fields. We show that upon training, DeepONets can be over five orders of magnitude faster than the CFD solver employed to generate the training data and yield good accuracy for unseen Mach numbers within the range of training. Outside this range, DeepONet can still predict accurately and fast if a few sparse measurements are available. We then propose a composite supervised neural network, DeepM\&Mnet, that uses multiple pre-trained DeepONets as building blocks and scattered measurements to infer the set of all seven fields in the entire domain of interest. Two DeepM\&Mnet architectures are tested, and we demonstrate the accuracy and capacity for efficient data assimilation. DeepM\&Mnet is simple and general: it can be employed to construct complex multiphysics and multiscale models and assimilate sparse measurements using pre-trained DeepONets in a "plug-and-play" mode.},

  abstract = {In this work we investigate the possibility of using physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to approximate the Euler equations that model high-speed aerodynamic flows. In particular, we solve both the forward and inverse problems in one-dimensional and two-dimensional domains. For the forward problem, we utilize the Euler equations and the initial/boundary conditions to formulate the loss function, and solve the one-dimensional Euler equations with smooth solutions and with solutions that have a contact discontinuity as well as a two-dimensional oblique shock wave problem. We demonstrate that we can capture the solutions with only a few scattered points clustered randomly around the discontinuities. For the inverse problem, motivated by mimicking the Schlieren photography experimental technique used traditionally in high-speed aerodynamics, we use the data on density gradient {$\nabla\rho$}(x,t), the pressure p(x{${_\ast}$},t) at a specified point x=x{${_\ast}$} as well as the conservation laws to infer all states of interest (density, velocity and pressure fields). We present illustrative benchmark examples for both the problem with smooth solutions and Riemann problems (Sod and Lax problems) with PINNs, demonstrating that all inferred states are in good agreement with the reference solutions. Moreover, we show that the choice of the position of the point x{${_\ast}$} plays an important role in the learning process. In particular, for the problem with smooth solutions we can randomly choose the position of the point x{${_\ast}$} from the computational domain, while for the Sod or Lax problem, we have to choose the position of the point x{${_\ast}$} from the domain between the initial discontinuous point and the shock position of the final time. We also solve the inverse problem by combining the aforementioned data and the Euler equations in characteristic form, showing that the results obtained by using the Euler equations in characteristic form are better than that obtained by using the Euler equations in conservative form. Furthermore, we consider another type of inverse problem, specifically, we employ PINNs to learn the value of the parameter {$\gamma$} in the equation of state for the parameterized two-dimensional oblique wave problem by using the given data of the density, velocity and the pressure, and we identify the parameter {$\gamma$} accurately. Taken together, our results demonstrate that in the current form, where the conservation laws are imposed at random points, PINNs are not as accurate as traditional numerical methods for forward problems but they are superior for inverse problems that cannot even be solved with standard techniques.},

The numerical model takes into account different interactions such as repulsion, dissipation, friction and adhesion that occur when there is contact between two bodies. The powder grains are assumed to be perfectly spherical. The surface roughness of the plate and spreader is taken into account in the simulations as it has a significant impact on the powder bed spreading. The effect of material parameters such as friction and adhesion is studied. The influence of the spreading speed is also studied. The results show that different friction values give the same results on the final properties of the powder bed while adhesion plays a significant role.

The modified alloy is characterized by densification levels similar to the base alloy, with relative density superior to 99.8\%. The material exhibits Ti-rich segregations along the melt pool contours. Moreover, Ti tends to be entrapped in the interdendritic areas during solidification in the as-built state. After heat treatments, the modified Inconel 625 version presents greater hardness and tensile strengths than the base alloy in the same heat-treated conditions. For the solution annealed state, this is mainly attributed to the elimination of the segregations into the interdendritic structures, thus triggering solute strengthening. Finally, for the aged state, the further increment of mechanical properties can be attributed to a more intense formation of phases than the base alloy, due to elevated precipitation strengthening ability under heat treatments. It is interesting to note how slight chemical composition modification can directly develop new alloys by the LPBF process.},

PINNs have emerged as a new essential tool to solve various challenging problems, including computing linear systems arising from PDEs, a task for which several traditional methods exist. In this work, we focus first on evaluating the potential of PINNs as linear solvers in the case of the Poisson equation, an omnipresent equation in scientific computing. We characterize PINN linear solvers in terms of accuracy and performance under different network configurations (depth, activation functions, input data set distribution). We highlight the critical role of transfer learning. Our results show that low-frequency components of the solution converge quickly as an effect of the F-principle. In contrast, an accurate solution of the high frequencies requires an exceedingly long time. To address this limitation, we propose integrating PINNs into traditional linear solvers. We show that this integration leads to the development of new solvers whose performance is on par with other high-performance solvers, such as PETSc conjugate gradient linear solvers, in terms of performance and accuracy. Overall, while the accuracy and computational performance are still a limiting factor for the direct use of PINN linear solvers, hybrid strategies combining old traditional linear solver approaches with new emerging deep-learning techniques are among the most promising methods for developing a new class of linear solvers.},

  abstract = {Laser powder bed fusion additive manufacturing is an emerging 3D printing technique for the fabrication of advanced metal components. Widespread adoption of it and similar additive technologies is hampered by poor understanding of laser-metal interactions under such extreme thermal regimes. Here, we elucidate the mechanism of pore formation and liquid-solid interface dynamics during typical laser powder bed fusion conditions using in situ X-ray imaging and multi-physics simulations. Pores are revealed to form during changes in laser scan velocity due to the rapid formation then collapse of deep keyhole depressions in the surface which traps inert shielding gas in the solidifying metal. We develop a universal mitigation strategy which eliminates this pore formation process and improves the geometric quality of melt tracks. Our results provide insight into the physics of laser-metal interaction and demonstrate the potential for science-based approaches to improve confidence in components produced by laser powder bed fusion.},

  abstract = {In the laser-based powder bed fusion process (L-PBF), the used powder is exposed to a multitude of mechanical and atmospheric parameters along the entire process chain, beginning with the production of the powder, over transportation, storage and processing and ending with the recycling of the material. The chemical composition and shape of individual powder particles, for example, as well as the characteristic properties of the entire powdered material change depending on the duration and intensity of the effects of, among other things, the atmosphere, temperature, humidity and external forces. Once the influencing variables and their effects are known, the changes in the powder can be counteracted in a targeted manner. In this way, it is possible to restore or maintain the powder properties relevant to the L-PBF process, making the overall process more robust and reliable. This paper discusses the results of investigations on significant influencing factors that cause a change in the powder material during L-PBF, representing the cost-intensive titanium alloy Ti-6Al-4V. The results can be used to derive powder handling and management recommendations that can ensure powder quality throughout the service life.}

However, with such high thermal gradients which are usually present in these processes, manufacturing distortions may result in the creation of unacceptable parts. This paper presents an approach to compensate input STL files based on registration of the point cloud from sacrificial part builds. A novel strain energy based non-rigid registration algorithm has been developed for robust registration of data points to the original computer-aided design (CAD) model. A neural network based approach is used to learn the deformation of the geometry based on the deviation of the scan geometry. This network is subsequently used to modify the STL file to generate a new compensated STL file. The compensated STL file was validated by building parts and comparing the change in the part distortion.}

  abstract = {The present study considers the effects of process parameters on the microstructural development and mechanical properties of SLM Inconel 718. A continuous scanning strategy was used in conjunction with changes in laser spot size to emphasize texture development in the samples; it was found that aligned laser scan vectors (continuous scans) enhanced the crystallographic and morphological texture that forms during solidification when compared to multi-directional scan vectors (island scans). Although room temperature tensile testing did not exhibit variation in material properties, creep rupture testing showed a significant difference in ductility and time to failure. As texture and preferred crystallographic orientation were increased parallel to the loading direction, an increase of 51\% in creep elongation was observed for the continuous scanning strategy. This behavior is linked to differences in damage accumulation mechanisms in the microstructure based on grain boundary orientation and precipitation. Furthermore, comparison of the mechanical behavior of SLM and wrought materials showed that wrought had \textasciitilde 10\% greater tensile yield strength at room temperature, while in creep rupture the increase in elongation was as high as 640\%. The primary difference between SLM and wrought material contributing to this discrepancy was the difference in NbC distribution. Although small differences in mechanical behavior can be induced in SLM material through process parameter variation, the separation in properties when compared to a wrought product are more significant.}

  abstract = {Additive manufacturing (AM), widely known as 3D printing, is a direct digital manufacturing process, where a component can be produced layer by layer from 3D digital data with no or minimal use of machining, molding, or casting. AM has developed rapidly in the last 10~years and has demonstrated significant potential in cost reduction of performance-critical components. This can be realized through improved design freedom, reduced material waste, and reduced post processing steps. Modeling AM processes not only provides important insight in competing physical phenomena that lead to final material properties and product quality but also provides the means to exploit the design space towards functional products and materials. The length- and timescales required to model AM processes and to predict the final workpiece characteristics are very challenging. Models must span length scales resolving powder particle diameters, the build chamber dimensions, and several hundreds or thousands of meters of heat source trajectories. Depending on the scan speed, the heat source interaction time with feedstock can be as short as a few microseconds, whereas the build time can span several hours or days depending on the size of the workpiece and the AM process used. Models also have to deal with multiple physical aspects such as heat transfer and phase changes as well as the evolution of the material properties and residual stresses throughout the build time. The modeling task is therefore a multi-scale, multi-physics endeavor calling for a complex interaction of multiple algorithms. This paper discusses models required to span the scope of AM processes with a particular focus towards predicting as-built material characteristics and residual stresses of the final build. Verification and validation examples are presented, the over-spanning goal is to provide an overview of currently available modeling tools and how they can contribute to maturing additive manufacturing.},

  abstract = {For additive manufacturing such as laser powder bed fusion (LPBF), commercial aluminum alloy (AA) 6061 is typically considered unsuitable due to formation of solidification cracking and/or excessive porosity. In this study, to improve buildability/printability of AA6061, 1wt. \% of Zr was alloyed to produce Zr-modified AA6061 by LPBF. Powders of unmodified and Zr-modified AA6061 were produced by gas atomization, and utilized as a feed-stock for the LPBF to fabricate specimens for microstructural examination and mechanical testing. The as-built unmodified AA6061 exhibited poor printability due to formation of cracks and porosity in the microstructure regardless of LPBF parameters. However, the Zr-modified AA6061 exhibited near full density, with substantial reduction in porosities without any solidification crack for a certain LPBF processing window. The improved printability of Zr-modified AA6061 was attributed to a significant grain refinement, which would reduce the solidification cracking susceptibility by hampering the epitaxial growth of long columnar cracks, as observed in unmodified AA6061. Yield strength, tensile strength and strain-at-failure for the as-built Zr-modified AA6061 were determined to be 210MPa, 268MPa, and 26.5\%, respectively. These are superior to the tensile properties of AA6061 in O-annealed condition or in as-cast condition. After T6 heat treatment, yield strength, tensile strength and strain-at-failure of Zr-modified AA6061 were determined to be 300MPa, 327MPa, and 14\%, which were again superior to the tensile properties of wrought AA6061 in T6 heat treated condition. Effects of Zr addition on the buildability/printability improvement and mechanical properties of AA6061 were corroborated by a variety of electron microscopic characterization.},

Microstructural characteristics of the most dense sample were examined using electron microscopy (SEM, TEM) and X-ray Diffraction. The grains in the top-most melt pool layer showed a fan-like structure, whereas all other area showed small columnar structure aligned nearly parallel to the build direction due to multiple melt-solidification cycles. The high cooling rates associated with LPBF yielded a fine dendritic microstructure, which consisted of primary {$\alpha$}1(Cu) dendrites and a mixture of {$\alpha$}2(Cu) and {$\delta$} (Cu41Sn11) phases in the interdendritic region. In addition, formation of thin laths ({$\sim$}120\,nm) was observed by TEM presumably due to diffusionless martensitic transformation from the high temperature {$\beta$} phase associated with fast cooling rates. The primary {$\alpha$}1(Cu) dendrite and {$\alpha$}2(Cu) within the interdendritic region contained low ({$\sim$}6.6\,wt\%) and high ({$\sim$}11.9\,wt\%) Sn concentration, respectively.

  abstract = {Laser-based metal processing including welding and three dimensional printing, involves localized melting of solid or granular raw material, surface tension-driven melt flow and significant evaporation of melt due to the applied very high energy densities. The present work proposes a weakly compressible smoothed particle hydrodynamics formulation for thermo-capillary phase change problems involving solid, liquid and gaseous phases with special focus on selective laser melting, an emerging metal additive manufacturing technique. Evaporation-induced recoil pressure, temperature-dependent surface tension and wetting forces are considered as mechanical interface fluxes, while a Gaussian laser beam heat source and evaporation-induced heat losses are considered as thermal interface fluxes. A novel interface stabilization scheme is proposed, which is shown to allow for a stable and smooth liquid-gas interface by effectively damping spurious interface flows as typically occurring in continuum surface force approaches. Moreover, discretization strategies for the tangential projection of the temperature gradient, as required for the discrete Marangoni forces, are critically reviewed. The proposed formulation is deemed especially suitable for modeling of the melt pool dynamics in metal additive manufacturing because the full range of relevant interface forces is considered and the explicit resolution of the atmospheric gas phase enables a consistent description of pore formation by gas inclusion. The accuracy and robustness of the individual model and method building blocks is verified by means of several selected examples in the context of the selective laser melting process.},

  abstract = {Powder bed fusion additive manufacturing (PBFAM) of metals has the potential to enable new paradigms of product design, manufacturing and supply chains while accelerating the realization of new technologies in the medical, aerospace, and other industries. Currently, wider adoption of PBFAM is held back by difficulty in part qualification, high production costs and low production rates, as extensive process tuning, post-processing, and inspection are required before a final part can be produced and deployed. Physics-based modeling and predictive simulation of PBFAM offers the potential to advance fundamental understanding of physical mechanisms that initiate process instabilities and cause defects. In turn, these insights can help link process and feedstock parameters with resulting part and material properties, thereby predicting optimal processing conditions and inspiring the development of improved processing hardware, strategies and materials. This work presents recent developments of our research team in the modeling of metal PBFAM processes spanning length scales, namely mesoscale powder modeling, mesoscale melt pool modeling, macroscale thermo-solid-mechanical modeling and microstructure modeling. Ongoing work in experimental validation of these models is also summarized. In conclusion, we discuss the interplay of these individual submodels within an integrated overall modeling approach, along with future research directions.},

  abstract = {The build orientation of parts which are produced by Additive Manufacturing processes has a considerable effect on material and energy consumptions. The choice of a specific build orientation from the range available is crucial because it has a direct impact on the economic and environmental aspects of part production. Several methods based on functional, economic and environmental requirements have been proposed to automate the choice of an optimal orientation. Those approaches involve trade-off conditions concerning environmental aspects that emerge from scientific investigations. Impact indicators are generally aggregated for the purpose of comparison. This approach allows a reduction in the number of items to be compared before making a decision, but some information provided from the life cycle assessment analysis is lost or not fully exploited. This paper proposes an innovative procedure to overcome these limitations. Firstly, life-cycle impact assessment indicators of the process are considered as the objectives to model the Pareto front of environmentally non-dominated solutions. This first step of the proposed method uses evolutionary algorithms. Then, all the orientations that passed the first selection step are ranked based on their estimated cost to find the optimal solution, which corresponds to the optimal orientation. This approach considers all the environmental impacts during the multi-objective optimisation, according to the principles of impact assessment. This procedure can be applied to any combination of products and additive manufacturing processes. The proposed method is applied to three additive manufacturing technologies to prove its adaptability. Three popular sample parts are used as benchmarks. The application shows that considerable environmental and economical benefits can be achieved through the proposed approach. All tests are repeated using two different evolutionary algorithms to show the effects of the calculation method on Pareto results.},

  abstract = {Quality inconsistency due to uncertainty hinders the extensive applications of laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF) additive manufacturing process. To address this issue, this study proposes a new and efficient probabilistic method for the reliability analysis and design of the L-PBF process. The method determines a feasible region of the design space for given design requirements at specified reliability levels. If a design point falls into the feasible region, the design requirement will be satisfied with a probability higher or equal to the specified reliability. Since the problem involves the inverse reliability analysis that requires calling the direct reliability analysis repeatedly, directly using Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) is computationally intractable, especially for a high reliability requirement. In this work, a new algorithm is developed to combine MCS and the First Order Reliability Method (FORM). The algorithm finds the initial feasible region quickly by FORM and then updates it with higher accuracy by MCS. The method is applied to several case studies, where the normalized enthalpy criterion is used as a design requirement. The feasible regions of the normalized enthalpy criterion are obtained as contours with respect to the laser power and laser scan speed at different reliability levels, accounting for uncertainty in seven processing and material parameters. The results show that the proposed method dramatically alleviates the computational cost while maintaining high accuracy. This work provides a guidance for the process design with required reliability.},

The nondestructive testing technology for the quality monitoring of L-DED processed parts is becoming more and more demanding in terms of accuracy, real-time, and ease of operation. This paper introduces a new image recognition system based on a deep convolutional neural network, which uses multiple lightweight architectures to reduce detection time. In order to eliminate the interference better, it improves the penalty function, which effectively improves the accuracy. Judging from the detection results of the data set, the accuracy of the model training reaches 94.71\%, which achieves a very good image segmentation effect and solves the technical problem of in-situ monitoring of the L-DED process. This system realizes the positioning of the spatters for the first time, and at the same time, the number of spatters and area of molten pool are correlated to the laser scanning speed and the laser power.},

  abstract = {Residual stress (RS) is the most challenging problem in metal additive manufacturing (AM) since the build-up of high tensile RS may influence the fatigue life, corrosion resistance, crack initiation, and failure of the additively manufactured components. While tensile RS is inherent in all the AM processes, fast and accurate prediction of the stress state within the part is extremely valuable and results in optimization of the process parameters to achieve a desired RS and control of the build process. This paper proposes a physics-based analytical model to rapidly and accurately predict the RS within the additively manufactured part. In this model, a transient moving point heat source (HS) is utilized to determine the temperature field. Due to the high temperature gradient within the proximity of the melt pool area, the material experiences high thermal stress. Thermal stress is calculated by combining three sources of stresses known as stresses due to the body forces, normal tension, and hydrostatic stress in a homogeneous semi-infinite medium. The thermal stress determines the RS state within the part. Consequently, by taking the thermal stress history as an input, both the in-plane and out of plane RS distributions are found from the incremental plasticity and kinematic hardening behavior of the metal by considering volume conservation in plastic deformation in coupling with the equilibrium and compatibility conditions. In this modeling, material properties are temperature-sensitive since the steep temperature gradient varies the properties significantly. Moreover, the energy needed for the solid-state phase transition is reflected by modifying the specific heat employing the latent heat of fusion. Furthermore, the multi-layer and multi-scan aspects of metal AM are considered by including the temperature history from previous layers and scans. Results from the analytical RS model presented excellent agreement with XRD measurements employed to determine the RS in the Ti-6Al-4V specimens.},

Metal additive manufacturing (AM) involves multiple physical phenomena and parameters that potentially affect the quality of the final part. To capture the dynamics and complexity of heat and phase transformations that exist in the metal L-PBF process, computational models and simulations ranging from low to high fidelity have been developed. Since it is difficult to incorporate all the physical phenomena encountered in the L-PBF process, computational models rely on assumptions that may neglect or simplify some physics of the process. Modeling assumptions and uncertainty play significant role in the predictive accuracy of such L-PBF models. In this study, sources of modeling inaccuracy at different stages of the process from powder bed formation to melting and solidification are reviewed. The sources of parameter uncertainty related to material properties and process parameters are also reviewed. The aim of this review is to support the development of an approach to quantify these sources of uncertainty in L-PBF models in the future. The quantification of uncertainty sources is necessary for understanding the tradeoffs in model fidelity and guiding the selection of a model suitable for its intended purpose.},

So far, several HEAs with outstanding properties beyond those of conventional alloys have been discovered, and new superior high-entropy alloys are still expected to be developed in the future. However, the fabrication process of HEAs through conventional manufacturing techniques suffers from significant limitations due to the intrinsic requirements of HEAs. Additive manufacturing (AM), on the other hand, has provided new opportunities for fabricating geometrically complex HEAs with the possibility of in situ tailoring of their microstructure features. Considering the growing interest in AM of HEAs during most recent years, this review article aims at providing the state of the art in AM of HEAs. It describes the feedstock requirements for laser based AM techniques. Thereafter, a comprehensive picture of the current state of nearly all HEAs processed by laser metal deposition (LMD), selective laser melting (SLM) and selective electron beam melting (SEBM) is presented. Special attention is paid to the features of AM derived microstructures along with their outstanding properties and underlying mechanisms for various material processing combinations. The AM of interstitial solute hardening HEAs, HEA matrix composites as well as non-beam based AM of HEAs will also be addressed. The post-AM treatments and the strategies to fabricate defect-free HEAs are summarized. Finally, a conclusion of current state and future prospects of additive manufacturing of HEAs will be presented.},

  abstract = {In this work, a new approach is developed to integrate a particle-based (seed crystals) nucleation mechanism into the Cellular Automata (CA) simulation of powder-bed laser beam melting. The model aims to reflect two features observed in the microstructures of additively manufactured Al alloys: the fusion boundary nucleation which violates the principle of common bulk nucleation favored under high solidification rates and low thermal gradients, and the epitaxial growth at the melt-pool bottom as observed in the microstructure of AlSi10Mg alloy. Based on the proposed nucleation model, a CA cell will accommodate a nucleus after a few physics-based nomination and activation criteria have been passed. The fusion boundary nucleation can be reproduced by the model with a nomination criterion that restricts nucleation to the CA cells having a maximum experienced temperature below the particle dissolution temperature. However, the second observed feature needs an additional criterion to incorporate the nucleation incubation time. This is interpreted through the competition between the epitaxial growth and the nucleation which results in different behaviors at different melt-pool regions. Accordingly, the model offers high flexibility in calibration based on the growth and nucleation kinetics. The set of parameters used for AlSi10Mg are capable to deliver a similar microstructure and texture compared to the experiments. Moreover, a very high nucleation density along with a lower nucleation incubation time can lead to the bimodal grain structure observed in Sc-modified aluminum alloys.},

This study investigates the effect of ILT with respect to build height and under distinct levels of volumetric energy density (VED) using the example of 316L stainless steel. In-situ thermography is used to gather information on cooling conditions during the process, which is followed by an extensive metallographic analysis. Significant effects of ILT and build height on heat accumulation, sub-grain sizes, melt pool geometries and hardness are presented. Furthermore, the rise of defect densities can be attributed to a mutual interplay of build height and ILT. Hence, ILT has been identified as a crucial factor for L-PBF of real part components especially for those with small cross sections.},

Both sensors are focused on capturing the dynamic phenomena around the melt pool region. To detect lack-of-fusion defects, we fuse (combine) the data from the in-process sensors invoking the concept of Kronecker product of graphs. Subsequently, we use the features derived from the graph Kronecker product as inputs to a machine learning algorithm to predict the severity (class or level) of average length of lack-of-fusion defects within a layer, which is obtained from offline X-ray computed tomography of the test parts. We demonstrate that the severity of lack-of-fusion defects is classified with statistical fidelity (F-score) close to 85\% for a two-level classification scenario, and approximately 70\% for a three-level classification scenario. Accordingly, this work demonstrates the use of heterogeneous in-process sensing and online data analytics for in situ detection of defects in DED metal AM process.},

  abstract = {The goal of this work is to detect the onset of material cross-contamination in laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF) additive manufacturing (AM) process using data from in situ sensors. Material cross-contamination refers to trace foreign materials that may be introduced in the powder feedstock used in the process due to reasons such as poor cleaning of the machine after previous builds or inadequate quality control during production and storage of the powder. Material cross-contamination may lead to deleterious changes in the microstructure of the AM part and consequently affect its functional properties. Accordingly, the objective of this work is to develop and apply a spectral graph theoretic approach to detect the occurrence of material cross-contamination in real-time as the part is being built using in-process sensors. The central hypothesis is that transforming the process signals in the spectral graph domain leads to early and more accurate detection of material cross-contamination in L-PBF compared to the traditional delay-embedded Bon-Jenkins stochastic time series analysis techniques, such as autoregressive (AR) and autoregressive moving average (ARMA) modeling. To test this hypothesis, Inconel alloy 625 (UNS alloy 06625) test parts were made at Edison Welding Institute (EWI) on a custom-built L-PBF apparatus integrated with multiple sensors, including a silicon photodetector (with 300\,nm to 1100\,nm optical wavelength). During the process, two types of foreign contaminant materials, namely, tungsten and aluminum particulates, under varying degrees of severity were introduced. To detect cross-contamination in the part, the photodetector sensor signatures were monitored hatch-by-hatch in the form of spectral graph transform coefficients. These spectral graph coefficients are subsequently tracked on a Hotelling T2 statistical control chart. Instances of Type II statistical error, i.e., probability of failing to detect the onset of material cross-contamination, were verified against X-ray computed tomography (XCT) scans of the part to be within 5\% in the case of aluminum contaminant particles. In contrast, traditional stochastic time series modeling approaches, e.g., ARMA, had corresponding Type II error exceeding 15\%. Furthermore, the computation time for the spectral graph approach was found to be less than one millisecond, compared to nearly 100\,ms for the traditional time series models tested.},

  abstract = {The goal of this work is to monitor the laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) process using an array of sensors so that a record may be made of those temporal and spatial build locations where there is a high probability of defect formation. In pursuit of this goal, a commercial LPBF machine at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) was integrated with three types of sensors, namely, a photodetector, high-speed visible camera, and short wave infrared (SWIR) thermal camera with the following objectives: (1) to develop and apply a spectral graph theoretic approach to monitor the LPBF build condition from the data acquired by the three sensors; (2) to compare results from the three different sensors in terms of their statistical fidelity in distinguishing between different build conditions. The first objective will lead to early identification of incipient defects from in-process sensor data. The second objective will ascertain the monitoring fidelity tradeoff involved in replacing an expensive sensor, such as a thermal camera, with a relatively inexpensive, low resolution sensor, e.g., a photodetector. As a first-step toward detection of defects and process irregularities that occur in practical LPBF scenarios, this work focuses on capturing and differentiating the distinctive thermal signatures that manifest in parts with overhang features. Overhang features can significantly decrease the ability of laser heat to diffuse from the heat source. This constrained heat flux may lead to issues such as poor surface finish, distortion, and microstructure inhomogeneity. In this work, experimental sensor data are acquired during LPBF of a simple test part having an overhang angle of 40.5\,deg. Extracting and detecting the difference in sensor signatures for such a simple case is the first-step toward in situ defect detection in additive manufacturing (AM). The proposed approach uses the Eigen spectrum of the spectral graph Laplacian matrix as a derived signature from the three different sensors to discriminate the thermal history of overhang features from that of the bulk areas of the part. The statistical accuracy for isolating the thermal patterns belonging to bulk and overhang features in terms of the F-score is as follows: (a) F-score of 95\% from the SWIR thermal camera signatures; (b) 83\% with the high-speed visible camera; (c) 79\% with the photodetector. In comparison, conventional signal analysis techniques\textemdash e.g., neural networks, support vector machines, linear discriminant analysis were evaluated with F-score in the range of 40\textendash 60\%.},

Formation of strong texture, columnar grains, and chemical inhomogeneity in AM-designed alloys are among the serious challenges dealt with in various research works. This paper addresses these challenges for the first time for a Ti6Al4V-7Cu alloy produced via Electron Beam Powder Bed Fusion (EB-PBF) method following an in-situ alloying approach. In this work, a mixture of Ti6Al4V and elemental Cu powders was used as the feedstock. The results showed a relatively homogenous Cu distribution in the product due to the large melt pool created during the EB-PBF process, a development indicating the method's applicability for in-situ alloying and alloy design. The prior {$\beta$} columnar grains were effectively converted into equiaxed grains due to a constitutionally supercooled zone created by the rejection of Cu solutes in front of the solidification front and a relatively lower thermal gradient during EB-PBF compared with other AM processes. The addition of Cu enhanced the microhardness of Ti6Al4V, which could be considered an outcome of equiaxed grain formation, solid solution strengthening mechanism, and Ti2Cu intermetallic precipitation.},

Additive manufacturing (AM), as an emerging technology, has re-shaped the manufacturing strategies and largely influenced the industrial production lines. The feedstock, the main concern with regard to the powder-based AM methods, are mostly in the form of pre-alloyed powders. Pre-alloyed powders have a narrow composition range, suffer from limited availability and are expensive, making additive manufacturing of new alloys inflexible and costly. A growing number of works in the literature are dedicated to AM in-situ alloying, i.e. employing pure elemental blends as opposed to pre-alloyed ones for producing samples using additive manufacturing. This strategy gives added flexibility to the AM methods by benefiting from the laser local energy and paves the way towards an on-demand alloy design framework that is proportionate to the growing needs of the industry. This review is intended to shed light on the key components of AM in-situ alloying process, from initial blend preparation to requirements for the final composition homogeneity.},

However, thorough understanding of the detailed microstructural evolution during various additive manufacturing techniques is lacking when compared to conventionally produced counterparts. As such, the present work contributes to filling this gap in knowledge by using advanced microscopy techniques to analyse the microstructure of 316L stainless steel builds produced by laser powder bed fusion. The results show that changes in processing parameters lead to variations in grain structures, texture, and hardness. For instance, the dominant texture and grain structure is heavily influenced by changes to the laser scanning rotation between individual layers, while increasing laser power reduces hardness. The current study also provides additional insights into how grains in AM 316L steel accommodate strain. Due to the complex strain fields in austenite grains, they are usually split into complex-shaped regions separated by dislocation boundaries with characters similar to deformation- and micro-band boundaries in conventionally deformed austenite. Through electron probe micro-analysis over a large area, the current study reveals the tendency of Mo and Si concentrations to fluctuate around the cell and melt pool boundaries.},

However, it is difficult to obtain a suitable combination of both strategies in the metal materials, that is, the coexistence of high-density dislocations and high-volume-fraction precipitates. Here, utilizing a three-dimensional (3D) printing technique, we have successfully achieved a combination of high-density dislocation structures and high-volume-fraction ductile nano-precipitates in a high-entropy alloy (HEA). This 3D-printed HEA, with a novelty dislocation-precipitate skeleton (DPS) architecture and high-density ductile nano-precipitations wrapped in the DPS, has an ultra-high tensile strength of {$\sim$} 1.8 GPa together with the maximum elongation of {$\sim$} 16\%. The ultra-high strength mainly comes from dislocation-precipitation synergistic strengthening, while the large ductility mainly originates from an evolution of multiple stacking fault (SF) structures. The DPS can not only slow down the dislocation movement during the strain process without completely hindering its motion, but more importantly, the DPS still has good structural stability during the deformation, which avoids any premature failure due to stress concentrations at the boundary. The DPS formation promotes the development of the metal-based 3D printing technique in the preparation of the high-performance materials, and it can provide an efficient pathway for further enhancement of the alloy properties.},

Our approach makes use of a discontinuous Galerkin discretization in a domain that is implicitly defined by means of a level set function. The zero iso-contour of this level set function is considered as an additional domain boundary where we weakly enforce boundary conditions in the same manner as in boundary-fitted cells. In order to retain the full order of convergence of the scheme, it is crucial to perform volume and surface integrals in boundary cells with high accuracy. This is achieved using a linear moment-fitting strategy. Moreover, we apply a non-intrusive cell-agglomeration technique that averts problems with very small and ill-shaped cuts. The robustness, accuracy, and convergence properties of the scheme are assessed in several two-dimensional test cases for the steady compressible Euler and Navier\textendash Stokes equations. Approximation orders range from 0 to 4, even though the approach directly generalizes to even higher orders. In all test cases with a sufficiently smooth solution, the experimental order of convergence matches the expected rate for discontinuous Galerkin schemes.

In this study, a three dimensional (3D) phase field-lattice Boltzmann (PF-LB) model was developed to simulate the CET in directional solidification of Inconel 718 alloy. The phase field (PF) method was used to determine the solid/liquid transition. The solute diffusion equation was solved by the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM), due to its suitability for parallel processing and its simplicity in terms of modeling complex boundaries. A CET solidification map was developed for different temperature gradients and growth rates and the evolution of dendrites for equiaxed, columnar, and mixed regimes was studied. The resulting microstructure for different growth regimes was demonstrated and discussed in terms of grain size and orientation. In addition, the variation of maximum solute concentration along the sample height was investigated. It was found that while initial grain size does not affect the average grain size for equiaxed growth, it affects the PDAS for columnar growth significantly. A model was proposed to predict the primary dendrite arm spacing for columnar growth in a wide range of temperature gradient, solidification rate, and initial grain size. The novelty of this model is in the inclusion of the effect of initial grain size, which is important in processes that involve melting and solidification on a preexisting substrate, such as welding and additive manufacturing.},

This process is multifaceted and pivotal to understand the underlying physics of the coalescence of powder particles during the process, which impacts the structural and mechanical properties of the build component. In this study, a classical molecular dynamics (MD) model is developed for the coalescence of pre-alloyed aluminum alloy (AlSi10Mg) particles during the laser additive manufacturing process. The model is employed to investigate the neck growth and coalescence kinetics of different pairs of particle size with changing the laser energy density from 7 to 17~J/mm2. The simulation results reveal that the unevenly sized particles undergo complete coalescence as compared with even-sized particles, and the neck growth rate of AlSi10Mg particles increases with an increase in laser energy density. Based on the present investigation, it is established that the coalescence kinetics of the AlSi10Mg nanoparticles are governed by the surface and volume diffusion and the surface energy reduction during the joining of particles. This analysis will act as a guideline to design process parameters and quality control for the printing of new components.},

  abstract = {Recently, a few computational methodologies and algorithms have been developed to simulate the microstructure evolution in powder bed fusion (PBF) additive manufacturing (AM) processes. However, none of these have attempted to simulate the grain structure evolution in multitrack, multilayer AM components in a fully 3D transient mode and for the entire AM geometry. In this work, a multiscale model, which consists of coupling a transient, discrete-source 3D AM process model with a 3D stochastic solidification structure model, was applied to quickly, efficiently, and accurately predict the grain structure evolution of IN625 alloys during Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF). The capabilities of this model include studying the effects of process parameters and part geometry on solidification conditions and their impact on the grain structure formation within multicomponent alloy parts processed via AM. Validation was accomplished based on single-layer LPBF IN625 benchmark experiments, previously performed and analyzed at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), USA. This modeling approach can also be used to quantitatively predict the solidification structure of Ti-6Al-4V alloys in electron beam AM processes.},

  abstract = {Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF) is one of the revolutionary technologies that can fabricate complex-shaped components by selective melting of the pre-placed powder layer, using high-power laser as directed by the input digital files. Generally, research on the LPBF process is called out for layer thickness (LT) up to 50 \textmu m and smaller beam diameter ({$\leq$}100 \textmu m), but it has lower productivity. In LPBF, higher productivity can be achieved with higher LT ({$>$}50 \textmu m), but it consists of various process instabilities. In the present work, parametric studies are performed by laying Ni-Cr-Fe-Nb-Mo single tracks, using LPBF at higher LT. The process parameters such as laser power (P), scan speed (v), and LT are varied among 150\textendash 450 W, 0.04\textendash 0.1 m s-1, and 80\textendash 160 \textmu m, respectively, at three levels each. For the range of parameters under investigation, the maximum track width of 610 \textmu m and aspect ratio of 7.63 are achieved at a P of 450 W and v of 0.04 m s-1 at 80 \textmu m LT. It is observed that an increase in the energy density and layer thickness resulted in the reduction of track width and aspect ratio due to material vaporization occurring from poor heat conductivity due to unconventionally high powder layer thickness. It is also observed that the build rate increases with an increase in P, v, and LT. As single tracks are basic building blocks, the obtained results can provide an insight into the effect of process parameters on LPBF-built single tracks at higher LT for building engineering components of required width with higher build rate. Furthermore, the track dilution is also found to increase with the increase in P and decrease in v.},

However, there is still a severe lack of algorithmic solutions to properly process the infrared images from these cameras that has led to several key limitations: a lack of online monitoring capabilities for the laser tracks, insufficient pre-processing of the infrared images for data-driven methods, and large memory requirements for storing the infrared images. To address these limitations, we study over 30 segmentation algorithms that segment each infrared image into a foreground and background. By evaluating each algorithm based on its segmentation accuracy, computational speed, and robustness against spatter detection, we identify promising algorithmic solutions. The identified algorithms can be readily applied to the selective laser sintering and selective laser melting machines to address each of the above limitations and thus, significantly improve process control.},

  abstract = {Metastable {$\beta$}-Ti alloys are attractive for additive manufacturing as they offer high strength and toughness, with the ability to readily tailor properties through control of the phase fraction and morphology of precipitate phases. However, during additive manufacturing processes thermal cycling associated with repetitive layer-by-layer deposition can potentially promote unintended {$\beta$}-phase decomposition and in-situ precipitation of other phases. This work investigates the stability of the {$\beta$}-phase during high heat input (1648~J/mm) Wire Arc Additive Manufacturing (WAAM) of Ti\textendash 3Al\textendash 8V\textendash 6Cr\textendash 4Mo\textendash 4Zr (Beta-C). Thermocouples and pyrometers to first used to measure the thermal environment during WAAM, and SEM, XRD and TEM characterisation techniques are used to investigate the microstructure of the as-built alloy. Despite observing large thermal excursions during WAAM well above the temperatures necessary to precipitate {$\alpha$}-phase, no evidence of {$\beta$}-phase decomposition was found during WAAM. A Time-Temperature-Transformation (TTT) diagram is used to show that the cooling rates are too fast and the cumulative thermal exposures are too short to decompose the {$\beta$}-phase during WAAM. Consequently, the alloy retains the bcc {$\beta$}-phase which gives the alloy moderate strength (tensile strength \textasciitilde 748~MPa) and good ductility (\textasciitilde 20\%) during WAAM.},

Concurrent topology optimization is commonly utilized for designing FGCSs; however, this approach suffers from an extremely high computational cost due to the complexity of the design problem. Recently, level-set-based methods, which rely on the implicit-based modeling technique, have gained increased attention and been considered as an efficient design tool for structures fabricated with AM. In this work, a multiscale structural optimization method for FGCS design utilizing level-set descriptions is proposed. Contrary to the well-known level-set topology optimization, in this approach, the shape is represented and parameterized with implicit functions, and the optimization process is performed to find the optimal parameters. The proposed method can replace topology optimization for microscale structural optimization within the multiscale structural design with reduced computation cost and comparable optimally designed results. Moreover, the unique behaviors of pre-selected cellular structures could be maintained during the optimization process by proper parametric constraints. The proposed design approach was validated through two design examples, both of which demonstrate remarkable structural performance enhancements in comparison with the single-scale design approach. Furthermore, two three-dimensional design examples, commonly found in automotive and aerospace industries, further prove the applicability of the proposed method in practice.},

  abstract = {Metal additive manufacturing based on powder bed fusion processes is increasingly important. However, highly transient physical phenomena that occur in these processes at different length scales are difficult to observe. Challenging and costly experiments are usually needed to obtain data for process understanding and improvement. Computational modelling of powder-bed fusion processes is therefore important from several points of view. These include better process understanding, optimisation of process parameters and component designs, prediction of component properties, qualification of components and to assist process control. Several physical processes have to be treated to develop a complete model, namely the raking of the powder bed surface, the transfer of energy from the laser or electron beam to the metal, the melting and solidification of the powder, the flow of liquid metal in the melt pool, the heat transfer from the melt pool to the surrounding powder and solid metal, the evolution of the microstructure, and the residual stress and deformation of the component. These processes occur at very different scales, and have to be treated using several different computational techniques. In addition, the interdependency of some of the processes has to be accounted for. This paper discusses the rationale for developing a complete model, progress in developing sub-models of the different physical processes, and the framework that is envisaged to combine the sub-models into a predictive model of the additive manufacturing process.},

  abstract = {Processes that use moving point heat sources to temporarily create localized melt pools (metal additive manufacture and fusion welding) have a flow phenomenon due to the surface tension gradient. Surface tension of the liquid metal reduces with temperature and this, coupled with the high temperature gradients associated with point heat sources, creates Marangoni convection in the melt. The Marangoni convection tends to reduce the temperature and change the melt pool geometry (increases width but reduces depth). Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) models can simulate the phenomenon of Marangoni convection but are computationally intensive. A simpler thermal model involving heat conduction and latent heat, but with the liquid's thermal conductivity artificially increased by a constant factor, exhibits similar thermal effects to the Marangoni convection. The heat conduction models are computationally less intensive than CFD, but the trial-and-error exercise needed to obtain an appropriate multiplying factor is time consuming. With an aim to improve the process of factor selection, the present study investigates the correlation between the surface tension gradient and correction factors. For a Ti-6Al-4V under typical additive manufacturing parameters, the corresponding correction factor to be applied to liquid thermal conductivity was 1.76.},

The temperature profile is calculated using a moving point heat source solution and heat sink solution with consideration of heat input from a moving laser and heat loss from boundary heat transfer.

The residual stress is calculated from the thermal stress calculation using an elastoplastic relaxation procedure.

However, the grains of the LPBF-processed AZ91D Mg-Al alloys could be coarse. The grains might undergo columnar growth, which is less resistant to hot tearing than equiaxed growth. Refining the microstructure by manipulating the processing parameters requires extensive experimental work. In this study, we used SiCnp-decorated AZ91D powder to additively manufacture AZ91D-SiCnp composites. The nanoparticles react with the melt, ensuring a high density of nucleation sites. The nanoparticles at the solid\textendash liquid interface significantly blocked the diffusion of Al solute atoms, leading to solute enrichment at the interface. The remaining melt undercooled to a greater extent comparing with the nanoparticle-free melt, thus more potential nucleus were activated. As a result, columnar-to-equiaxed transition of the grains' growth has been achieved and the grains' size has reduced significantly by assembling SiCnp onto the feedstock AZ91D powder.

  abstract = {Additive manufacturing of an equimolar CoCrNi medium entropy alloy (MEA) by selective laser melting (SLM) was investigated, emphasizing its microstructure, properties, and metallurgical defects. It was found that SLM sample density exhibited a non-monotonic relation with their volume energy density (VED); the density first increased but then decreased while the input VED was gradually increasing. A maximal relative density of 98.9 pct was accessible at a VED of 83.3 J/mm3. X-ray diffraction indicated that the printed CoCrNi MEA exhibited an FCC single-crystal structure where the lattice constant decreased with the increasing VED owing to the evaporation of the Cr element in the SLM process. The average grain size gradually increased with increasing VED, irrespective of whether viewed from the top or the side of the printed part. Similarly, the residual stress increased with increasing VED, which produced more microcracks and deteriorated the tensile preformation of the printed samples, although the yield strength (630 MPa) showed no apparent difference at different VEDs. Owing to the ultrafine cell structure, the mechanical property of the SLM printed sample was twice that of cast or wrought CoCrNi MEA.},

In this study, a non-equilibrium multi-phase field method (MPFM), which was based on a finite interface dissipation model proposed by Steinbach et. al., coupled with a CALPHAD database was developed for a multicomponent Ni alloy. A qua-si-equilibrium MPFM was also developed for comparison. Two-dimensional equiaxed micro-structural evolution for the Ni (Bal.)\&ndash;Al\&ndash;Co\&ndash;Cr\&ndash;Mo\&ndash;Ta\&ndash;Ti\&ndash;W\&ndash;C alloy was performed at various cooling rates. The temperature\&ndash;\&gamma; fraction profiles obtained under 10\^5 K/s using non- and qua-si-equilibrium MPFMs were in good agreement with each other. Over 10\^6 K/s, the differences between non- and quasi-equilibrium methods grew as the cooling rate increased. The non-equilibrium solidification was strengthened over a cooling rate of 10\^6 K/s. Colum-nar-solidification microstructural evolution was performed under cooling rates from 5\&times;10\^5 K/s to 1\&times;10\^7 K/s at various temperature gradient values under the constant interface velocity (0.1 m/s). The results showed that as the cooling rate increased, the cell space decreased in both methods, and the non-equilibrium MPFM agreed well with experimental measurements. Our results show that the non-equilibrium MPFM can simulate solidification microstructure in powder bed fusion additive manufacturing.},

  abstract = {Additive manufacturing (AM) has enabled the creation of geometrically complex parts for a range of industries. However, the nature of AM often requires multiple post processing techniques to be carried out to reach the desired material properties or required surface finish. This often involves heat treatment (HT), shot peening (SP) or laser shock peening (LSP). To date, hardly any process chain modelling has been carried out on manufacturing applications with AM. This investigation focuses on the finite element (FE) modelling of the complete manufacturing process chain of an AM impeller made of IN718, including the AM, HT, LSP and SP processes. The particular AM process applied to build the impeller is laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF). Each FE process is validated individually against experimental data before being applied to the impeller process chain. The validated data from each process is mapped to the next process in the chain to investigate the combined effects of manufacturing and post processing techniques. Results have shown that high tensile residual stresses induced by AM can be reduced by approximately 75\% by applying HT. SP and LSP processes can further modify remaining tensile residual stresses after HT by inducing a layer of compressive stresses at the surface. In summary, this research work has demonstrated that the simulation of AM process chains using finite element techniques is sufficiently mature to support the product and process development of industrial AM components.},

In Laser Powder Bed Fusion, components are built by selectively melting specific areas of the powder bed, to form the two-dimensional cross-section of the specific part. However, the high occurrence of defects impacts the adoption of this method for precision applications. Therefore, a control policy for dynamically altering process parameters to avoid phenomena that lead to defect occurrences is necessary. A Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) framework that derives a versatile control strategy for minimizing the likelihood of these defects is presented. The generated control policy alters the velocity of the laser during the melting process to ensure the consistency of the melt pool and reduce overheating in the generated product. The control policy is trained and validated on efficient simulations of the continuum temperature distribution of the powder bed layer under various laser trajectories.},

Compared to the conventional FEM using the global stiffness approach and a uniform mesh running on 10 CPU cores, l-PBF process simulation based on the proposed methodology running on a GPU card with 5,120 Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) cores enables a speedup of over 10,000x. This significant speedup facilitates detailed thermal history and melt pool geometry predictions at high resolution for centimeter-scale parts within days of computation time.

The proposed work presents an efficient adaptive remeshing technique that enables part-scale SLM process simulations and helps reduce model size without sacrificing accuracy with the purpose of making the part-scale simulation computationally efficient. In particular, the SLM process simulation for an entire part was developed with the capability of considering different process parameters. The model predicts the influence of process parameters on part thermal history, melt pool statistics, and porosity. The simulation results agree well with the experimental results in literature. In addition, the remeshing technique was demonstrated to be more computationally efficient than the existing element death and birth approach.}

Numerical methods including the finite element method have been widely used to predict parts thermal-structural history during the build process. However, the simulation has scalability issues because both layer thickness and laser spot diameter are too tiny compared to the part-scale. Therefore, it is only feasible to run these simulations with massive computational resources or if the boundary conditions are simplified, which inevitably reduces the prediction accuracy. This paper proposes a tetrahedral element-based scan-wise adaptive remeshing framework for thermal simulation of the selective laser melting (SLM) process. Results show that a significant reduction of the computational time and resources can be achieved due to the reduction of the number of nodes. The proposed framework enables part-scale thermal modeling of the SLM process with detailed thermal history without sacrificing the accuracy. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is demonstrated through a large size cantilever problem.},

This alloy, commonly used in the aeronautic and automotive industries, thanks to its excellent weight to strength ratio and high thermal conductivity, is particularly prone to hot cracking, in particular during LBM processing. The solution to remove cracks proposed in the present paper is to induce grain refinement to avoid the development of large columnar structures. To this end, various quantities of Yttrium Stabilized Zirconia (YSZ) are added to an Al6061 base powder using a dry mixing (Turbula\textregistered ) procedure. Experiments highlight a grain refinement effect depending on the added YSZ quantity. From 1 vol\% on, SEM and EBSD images reveal an equiaxed-columnar bimodal grain microstructure. Results show that the addition of 2 vol\% YSZ allows to fully avoid cracks due to a continuous equiaxed band at melt pool boudaries. Additionally, TEM and DRX investigations provide new insights into the becoming of added particles along the printing process. The experimental results are then discussed on the basis of a number of existing solidification models, with a focus on the necessary conditions for the establishment of an equiaxed solidification regime.},

Next to the vortex, depleted volumes appear that are entirely cleared of particles. This particle redistribution is caused by collisions of the tracers with the meniscus, which push the particles back onto the critical streamline with one particle radius distance to the meniscus. The streamlines between the meniscus and the critical streamline feed the depleted regions. Since the critical streamline depends on the particle radius, the effect leads to a particle fractionation according to their size. Diffusion allows only small particles to escape from the trap. Larger particles are permanently confined and their diffusion is rectified after every revolution at the meniscus, which produces a ratchet effect and increases the particle localization within the vortex.},

The deposited sample consisted of dendrite grains ranging in size from 5 to 15 \textmu m and interdendritic regions. The compressive yield strength and ultimate compressive strength of the obtained material are 550 and 1899 MPa. The microhardness test revealed an average value of 463 HV. The nanohardness and the elastic modulus of the sample are 10.4 and 304 GPa, respectively. Energy-dispersive spectroscopy showed that the elemental distribution in the top, middle, and bottom areas of the sample is uniform.

  abstract = {At present, most multiscale simulation approaches to model the temperature evolution of the molten pool, and the resulting microstructure evolution for selective laser melting, assume an equilibrium freezing range and steady state solidification conditions. This is despite the solidification conditions being observed to be highly unsteady and non-equilibrium. These two assumptions lead to inaccurate predictions of the temperature evolution of the molten pool and thus microstructure predictions. To demonstrate this, an approach to scale-bridging computational models of the laser additive manufacturing process is presented, in which the temperature history is passed from a macroscale molten pool simulation to a microscale phase-field simulation. This linkage is achieved by volume mapping of the temperature field from the grid of the molten pool simulation to the grid of the microstructure simulation. To describe the system evolution at the scale of the molten pool, a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) method that captures the laser-metal interaction, vapour production, gas recoil pressure, fluid flow, surface tension, Marangoni flow, and heat conduction, convection, and radiation is applied. To capture the chemical kinetics of the phase-transition, a non-equilibrium CALPHAD-integrated phase-field (PF) model is applied. The discrepancy between the predictions of the solid front isotherm is quantified as {$\geqslant$}100K for an Al-10Si alloy under the large observed cooling rate. This leads to a spatial discrepancy in the solidification front between the CFD model, which assumes equilibrium freezing behaviour, and the PF model, which does not, of approximately 10\textmu m over 50\textmu s in the present case. Under these conditions, present formulations of multiphase CFD cannot accurately predict the solidification behaviour because of the assumption of equilibrium at the solid\textendash liquid interface. Strategies for reconciling this discrepancy for materials that exhibit rapid solidification under large thermal undercooling will need to be developed for multiscale simulation of additive manufacturing to advance.},

An innovative method is proposed to compute the effective computation zone as boundary condition, which can save the computation time significantly. Notably, the computational efficiency can improve by 10\^4 to 10\^5 compared with finite element models. With this range of improvement efficiency, the temperature predicted based on this method is consistent (around 9\% of average deviation) with experimental measurements by thermocouple. This model can be used as a reference to define the boundary condition for further complex numerical analysis with improved accuracy at a reduction of efficiency as desired. In addition, it can be used as a reference to determine processing conditions that would allow the efficient and effective control of the temperature history within a range for a certain microstructure design.},

  abstract = {In 3D printing of bulk metallic glasses (BMGs) by selective laser melting (SLM), partial crystallization normally occurs in heat-affected zones (HAZs), which significantly deteriorates the properties of 3D-printed BMGs. To understand which factor dominates amorphous-to-crystalline conversion of 3D-printed BMGs, two representative BMG alloys with different glass forming ability (GFA), i.e., Zr55Cu30Ni5Al10 (named as Zr55 with high GFA) and Zr60.14Cu22.31Fe4.85Al9.7Ag3 (named as ZrAg with low GFA), were selected for SLM 3D printing, and their crystallization behaviors were comparatively studied. It is revealed that the 3D-printed ZrAg BMG with low GFA always possessed a higher amorphous phase content than the Zr55 BMG with a high GFA under different laser energy inputs. Thermal analysis and TEM observations revealed that crystal growth rate is the crucial factor for the resistance against amorphous-to-crystalline conversion in 3D-printed BMGs, as the ZrAg system exhibited much lower crystal growth rate although it has a lower GFA. The different crystal growth behavior of the two BMGs is associated with their different crystallization mechanisms: ZrAg BMG follows the mode of primary-type crystallization with multiple phases formation, leading to a low crystal growth rate, while Zr55 BMG follows the mode of polymorphous-type crystallization, which is characterized with formation of a simple crystalline phase, thus leading to a high crystal growth rate. The present work sheds light on the understanding of crystallization mechanism in 3D-printed BMGs and provides a guide for selection or design of BMG compositions for 3D printing.},

We propose a machine learning system detecting flaws and errors of a printer with varying difficulty.

To guarantee variety of the samples and more data different methods of data augmentation are applied. Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients and Mel filterbank energies are extracted from the recorded and augmented data to be used as features.

Increasing attention has been recently devoted to the possibility of using the same sensing approach to detect also in-plane and out-of-plane geometrical distortions of the part while it is being produced. To this aim, seminal works investigated the suitability of various image segmentation algorithms and assessed the accuracy of layerwise dimensional and geometrical measurements. Nevertheless, there is a lack of automated methods to identify, in-situ and in-process, geometrical defects and out-of-control deviations from the nominal geometry. This study presents a methodology that combines an active contours methodology for image segmentation with a statistical process monitoring approach suitable to deal with complex geometries that change layer by layer. The proposed approach enables a data-driven and automated alarm rule to detect the onset of geometrical distortions during the build by comparing the slice contour reconstruction with the nominal geometry in each layer. Moreover, by coupling edge-based and region-based segmentation techniques, the method is sufficiently robust to be applied to imaging and illumination setups that are already available on industrial L-PBF systems. The effectiveness of the proposed approach was tested on a real case study involving the L-PBF of complex Ti6Al4V parts that exhibited local geometrical distortions.},

So far, algorithms trained for monitoring a particular material type cannot be re-used to monitor another material in Additive Manufacturing (AM). This is a topic rarely researched in AM. Inspired by the idea of transfer learning in ML, we demonstrate the knowledge learned by the two native Deep Learning (DL) networks, namely VGG and ResNets, on four LPBF process mechanisms such as balling, Lack of Fusion (LoF) pores, conduction mode, and keyhole pores in stainless steel (316L) can be transferred to bronze (CuSn8). In this work, the spectrograms computed using Wavelet Transforms (WT) on Acoustic Emissions (AE) during the LBPF process of stainless steel and bronze are used for training the two DL networks. Either network is first trained for classification by spectrograms representing four mechanisms during the processing of stainless steel. The trained model is then re-trained using transfer learning with spectrograms from bronze data for a similar classification task. The accuracy of the two networks during transfer learning shows that it is effectively possible to learn transferable features from one material to another with minimum network training time and dataset collection.},

  abstract = {Metal-based Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF) suffers from a lack of repeatability and is challenging to model, making their quality monitoring essential and demanding. The reason lies in the high dynamics taking place during the interaction of the laser with metallic powders. To bring this technology to mass production, industries are only interested in the process regime where the built layer's quality meets their standards. All other process regimes leading to poor mechanical properties and/or defect formation such as balling, Lack of Fusion (LoF) pores, keyhole pores, delamination, and crack propagation irrespective of their different regimes are considered anomalies. Today, the common methodology for monitoring uses conventional/supervised Machine Learning (ML) algorithms for the classification task. However, it requires collecting a balanced dataset corresponding to each investigated regime from the sensors, which is very expensive and time-consuming. As an alternative, the article proposes a semi-supervised approach where the defect-free regime can be differentiated from the anomalies by familiarising the ML algorithms only with the distribution of acoustic signatures corresponding to the defect-free regime. This work presents two generative Convolutional Neural Network architectures based on Variational Auto-Encoder and General Adversarial Network. As a result, we could classify the anomaly regimes with 96 and 97\% accuracy, respectively.},

  abstract = {The instability of the Marangoni toroidal flows in microchannels is of interest in various areas such as microfluidics and heat transfer. Using pure liquid as working fluid in this study, the phenomena of Marangoni symmetry-to-asymmetry transition which does not arise from the buoyancy was observed. The experiments used a vertical cylindrical channel and the meniscus was formed at the bottom outlet to minimize the buoyant influences. Two microscopes were used to have top view and side view of the meniscus simultaneously. The Marangoni flow field on the meniscus was obtained by means of tracing particles. It was observed that the Marangoni flow on a concave meniscus was always nearly symmetrical, while that on a convex meniscus was out of symmetry with only one single vortex occupying the whole channel. The experimental results were highly consistent to the simulation results of authors' previous 3D numerical model (Pan and Wang in Microfluid Nanofluid 9:657, 2010). Theoretical analysis together with newly developed numerical models is employed to dig into the mechanisms. The inward (from the meniscus edge to the center) Marangoni flow is found not as stable as the outward one. Based on the heat transfer analysis, a concave meniscus always has a colder edge thus the flow is outward and stable; while a convex enough meniscus could have an inward flow thus not stable and tends to lose the symmetry. The amplification mechanism of the inward Marangoni flow is comprehensively explained. Two conditions are required for the inward flow to lose the symmetry, i.e., the bulk liquid must be warmer than the meniscus, and the Marangoni number must be above a certain small value.},

The segregations showed a coherent relationship with the matrix and reinforced it. Owing to their formation, the grain boundary energy was reduced.

  abstract = {In this paper, an integrated computational materials science approach for selective laser melting (SLM) at the mesoscale is presented. A particle dropping model was developed to simulate the representative powder-bed particle distribution of a measured titanium alloy powder. Thermal fluid flow and resulting microstructural evolution of a set of laser scanned single tracks with different powder layer thicknesses and scanning speeds during SLM were also studied using both computational and experimental approaches. The simulated powder particle distribution was found to be consistent with experimental measurement. The thermal fluid flow model predicts that single laser scanned tracks become increasingly irregular-shaped with increased powder layer thickness and increased laser scanning speed. These findings were reinforced by scanning electron microscopy analysis. The more dispersed dissipation of the localised heat for thicker powder layers is understood to cause increased melting and evaporation. This can lead to increased Marangoni force and recoil pressure which in turn destabilises the melt flow. The use of an argon atmosphere speeds up the solidification process when compared with air but does not affect the morphology of single tracks significantly. The predicted microstructure was consistent with the electron backscattered diffraction data. The microstructure-based modelling methodology considering the representative powder size distribution provides a good predictive capability for the laser-powder interaction behaviour, surface structure and porosity development.},

On the basis of data published in 2016-2019, an approach was adopted for a preliminary quantitative analysis of the knowledge base and also trends observed in the development of new technologies. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of the data mining technique based on the Bayes algorithm for analyzing trends in processes of additive manufacturing and the practical application of the knowledge received using the Bayes algorithm. After the analyses referred to above were completed, single and double layers of a composite material based on the Ni-based alloy and Fe-Al bronze were analyzed under different processing conditions. The effects of laser spot speeds and pitches on microhardness, microstructure, and interlayers' features were described. So, the innovative approach, namely, the combination of the analysis of the scientific database of the phenomenon under study and the subsequent experimental investigation of its features, is the scientific novelty of the present study.},

These columnar grains evolve from the partly molten grains in the substrate or the solidified metal. This work proposes an efficient model to simulate the competitive growth of epitaxial columnar dendritic grains. The proposed model tracks the dynamic changes in the dendrites emanating from discrete points along the solid/liquid interface of a quasi-steady melt pool (MP). These dynamic changes include convergence and divergence of growing dendrites. The model is extended to predict the microstructure of large 3D parts and experimentally validated by comparing the simulation results for laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF) and wire-arc additive manufacturing (WAAM) processes. The microstructure and pole figures are predicted for Inconel 718 samples produced by L-PBF and Inconel 740H samples produced by WAAM processes. The model predictions compare well with the observed microstructure and pole figures results for both the L-PBF and WAAM processes.},

In this work, we develop machine-learning methods to learn correlations between thermal history and subsurface porosity for a variety of print conditions in laser powder bed fusion.

To demonstrate the predictive power of these features, we present four statistical machine-learning models that correlate temperature histories to subsurface porosity formation in laser fused Ti-6Al-4\,V powder}

In this study, dedicated powder sampling from different positions within the build chamber and powder bed was performed. The results clearly indicate the importance of the surface-to-volume ratio of the built components on powder degradation, as demonstrated by the analysis of the powder using capsules filled with dense lattice structures. Extensive formation of Al- and Cr-rich oxides on the entrained powder deposited on the gas inlet and outlet was detected. Significant oxygen pick-up by spatter particles compared to the virgin powder was measured ({$>$}300\,ppm O2); while the as-built material experienced a slight loss (\textasciitilde 30\,ppm O2). The change in the microstructure of spatter particles in comparison to the virgin powder, namely the primary dendrite arm spacing, indicates significantly higher cooling rate during spatter solidification, estimated to be of about 108\,K/s, compared to around 106\,K/s for the virgin powder and 107\,K/s for the L-PBF component. These findings allows to evaluate the extent of powder degradation during L-PBF and establish the oxygen balance of the process.},

  abstract = {Advanced characterisation techniques were used on LPBF Ti-6Al-4V samples produced on a heated base plate. When the substrate temperature is 100\{\textbackslash deg\}C the elongation is 6\textbackslash\%, which increases and peaks at 10\textbackslash\% at 570\{\textbackslash deg\}C, then sharply decreases to zero ductility at 770\{\textbackslash deg\}C. At 100\{\textbackslash deg\}C, a heavily strained and twinned microstructure, primarily composed of \{\textbackslash alpha\}+\{\textbackslash alpha\}', was observed and it was comparable to asbuilt microstructures obtained by conventional LPBF methods. At higher temperatures, twins are no longer present and instead nano-scale \{\textbackslash beta\} precipitates are observed within \{\textbackslash alpha\}' and \{\textbackslash alpha\}, as well as dislocation networks (570\{\textbackslash deg\}C) and tangles (770\{\textbackslash deg\}C). Solute segregation at crystal defects was observed in all pre-heating conditions. Al and V segregation at microtwins was observed in the 100\{\textbackslash deg\}C sample, reporting for the first time `selective' and mutually exclusive Al- and V-rich regions forming in adjacent twins. V segregation at dislocations was observed in the 570\{\textbackslash deg\}C and 770\{\textbackslash deg\}C samples, consistent with the higher preheating temperatures. High O contents were measured in all samples but with apparent opposing effects. At 100\{\textbackslash deg\}C and 570\{\textbackslash deg\}C was estimated to be below the critical threshold for O embrittlement and locally aids in maintaining a strength high by solid solution strengthening, whereas at 770\{\textbackslash deg\}C it was above the threshold, therefore failing in a brittle fashion. Based on these observations, the initial increase in ductility from 100\{\textbackslash deg\}C to 570\{\textbackslash deg\}C is attributed to a reduction in microtwins and the dislocation networks acting as `soft barriers' for slip within a coarser microstructure. The lack of ductility at 770\{\textbackslash deg\}C was attributed to local solute redistribution causing dislocation pinning and an increase of O content in this sample.},

However, the vast composition space presents a significant practical challenge for optimization, particularly when relying on sequential use of conventional metallurgical fabrication and characterization methods. An efficient method for rapidly evaluating the properties of complex concentrated alloys is presented. Powder based directed energy deposition additive manufacturing was used to synthesize a broad range of compositions in a single metallurgical sample via in situ alloying. An investigation of the phase-property space was done by compositionally grading a transition metal-based HEA (CoCrFeMnNi) with several refractory metals (i.e., Ta, Nb, and Ti-6Al-4\,V). A high throughput microstructural-mechanical analysis method was also utilized to rapidly assess microstructure and hardness as a function of alloy composition. Compositions promoting solid solutions, multiple phases, and intermetallics were found to have a wide range of hardness and fabricability. These results are discussed in the context of alloy-specific microstructural characteristics and configurational entropy, along with relevant processing challenges.},

In addition to microstructural and mechanical characterization, synchrotron high speed x-ray computer aided tomography was conducted on a W20(CoCrFeMnNi)80 composition to visualize melting dynamics, powder-laser interactions, and remelting effects of previously consolidated material.

Unincorporated W particles also occured at W concentrations {$>$} 10at.\% accompanied by a dissolution band of Fe7W6 at the W/matrix interface and hardness values greater than 400 HV. The primary strengthening mechanism is attributed to the reinforcement of the Fe7W6 and W phases as a metal matrix composite. The in situ high speed x-ray imaging during remelting showed that an additional laser pass did not promote further mixing of the Fe7W6 or W phases suggesting that, despite the dissolution of the W into the Fe7W6 phase being thermodynamically favored, it is kinetically limited by the thickness/diffusivity of the intermetallic phase, and the rapid solidification of the laser-based process.},

The first-principles simulations exhibited that the in-situ formed TiC played a significant role as a diffusion barrier between diamond and HEA matrix, resulting in the reduction of sp2 hybridization of diamond and enhanced the interface bonding strength. The simulation results were further confirmed by experiments. In Ti-coated diamond-HEA composite fabricated by selective laser melting, the TiC layer obstructed the direct contact between diamond particles and the transition metal elements in HEA, thus preventing graphitization of diamond and enhancing the interface bonding strength. Moreover, part of Ti in Ti coating entered into the HEA matrix and increased the lattice distortion, resulting in substitutional solution strengthening effect and improving the retention on diamond abrasives. The superior wear properties of Ti-coated diamond composite attributed to the diffusion barrier of TiC and interfacial strengthening of TiC and Ti containing HEA solid solution.},

  abstract = {Qualification of aerospace components is a long and costly process involving material properties, material specifications, manufacturing process, and design among others. Reducing qualification time and cost while maintaining safety offers a large economic advantage and enables faster response to the market demands. In 2012, DARPA established the Open Manufacturing program, a project to develop an integrated computational materials engineering (ICME) framework aimed at rapid qualification. Rapid qualification requires the integration of several technologies: materials, process, design, models, monitoring and control, non-destructive evaluation (NDE), testing, among others. A probabilistic design approach is adopted in the rapid qualification process to enable the integration of these technologies into a single risk-based function to optimize the design process. This approach directs the efforts to those areas that play the most important roles, potentially reducing specimen testing that will be required to develop material databases and design limits. New tests also will be required to validate and verify the ICME framework and develop a better understanding of the processing-microstructure-property relation and associated variability of the processing conditions. The probabilistic design approach is demonstrated for the rapid qualification of an actual aircraft engine component constructed via the powder-bed additive manufacturing process. This paper summarizes the probabilistic rapid qualification design approach and its application to this novel manufacturing process with the goal of reducing the overall qualification process time by 40 \% and qualification process cost by 20 \%.},

Real data often requires some degree of composition, trivially exemplified by the mapping of ``first name'' and ``last name'' to ``full name'' on one end, to complex matchings, such as parsing and pairing symbol/digit strings to SSN numbers, at the other end of the spectrum. In this paper, we propose a two-phase instance-based technique for complex datatype property matching. Phase 1 computes the Estimate Mutual Information matrix of the property values to (1) find simple, 1:1 matches, and (2) compute a list of possible complex matches. Phase 2 applies Genetic Programming to the much reduced search space of candidate matches to find complex matches. We conclude with experimental results that illustrate how the technique works. Furthermore, we show that the proposed technique greatly improves results over those obtained if the Estimate Mutual Information matrix or the Genetic Programming techniques were to be used independently.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a complete concept and validation scheme for potential inter-layer flaw detection from in-situ process monitoring for powder bed fusion additive manufacturing (PBFAM) using supervised machine learning. Specifically, the presented work establishes a meaningful statistical correlation between (i) the multi-modal sensor footprint acquired during the build process, and (ii) the existence of flaws as indicated by post-build X-ray Computed Tomography (CT) scans. Multiple sensor modalities, such as layerwise imagery (both pre and post laser scan), acoustic and multi-spectral emissions, and information derived from the scan vector trajectories, contribute to the process footprint. Data registration techniques to properly merge spatial and temporal information are presented in detail. As a proof-of-concept, a neural network is used to fuse all available modalities, and discriminate flaws from nominal build conditions using only in-situ data. Experimental validation was carried out using a PBFAM sensor testbed available at PSU/ARL. Using four-fold cross-validation on a voxel-by-voxel basis, the null hypothesis, i.e. absence of a defect, was rejected at a rate corresponding to 98.5\% accuracy for binary classification. Additionally, a sensitivity study was conducted to assess the information content contributed by the individual sensor modalities. Information content was assessed by evaluating the resulting correlation as classification performance when using only a single modality or a subset of modalities. Although optical imagery contains the highest amount of information for flaw detection, additional information content observed in other modalities significantly improved classification performance.},

  abstract = {Generally, the evolution of metallic single crystals is based on crystal growth. The single crystal is either produced by growing a seed single crystal or by sophisticated grain selection processes followed by crystal growth. Here, we describe for the first time a fully new mechanism to generate single crystals based on thermo-mechanically induced texture formation during additive manufacturing. The single crystal develops due to two different mechanisms. The first step is a standard grain selection process due to directional solidification, leading to a pronounced fiber texture. The second and new mechanism bases on successive thermo-mechanically induced plastic deformations and texture formation in FCC crystals under compression. During this second step, the columnar grain structure transforms into a single crystal by rotation of individual grains. Thus, the single crystal forms step by step by merging the originally columnar grain structure. This novel, stress induced mechanism opens up completely new perspectives to fabricate single crystalline components and to accurately adjust the orientation according to the load.},

  abstract = {The present work proposes a fuzzy decision-making approach for the optimisation of the Laser Powder Bed Fusion (L-PBF) processing of AlSi10Mg alloy. First, a systematic approach based on Design of Experiment was adopted in order to identify and explain the effect of each operational parameter, i.e. volumetric energy density and building orientation, on the response variables, i.e. ultimate tensile strength, hardness and roughness. Then, a combined fuzzy-multi-objective genetic algorithm model was developed and tested in order to find the best input parameters' combination able to satisfy the requirement of the highest mechanical performances. The use of a multi-objective optimisation based on genetic algorithm concerned the computation of optimal fuzzy numbers in order to take into account a precise percentage of experimental data for a given degree of membership, in combination with the smallest uncertainty level. Moreover, from the technological point of view, the proposed experimental results showed a similar and even improved mechanical properties of the alloy, if compared with the die casted one, except for the roughness. Finally, the fuzzy process maps generated allow to select the operational parameters in order to obtain the desired process output, in combination with the lowest uncertainty level, providing, as additional information, how much the accuracy of the model and the process varies by changing those operational parameters.},

  abstract = {Process planning for additive manufacturing (AM) today relies heavily on multi-physics, multi-scale simulation. The focus of this paper is on one aspect of AM simulation, namely, part-level elasto-plastic simulation for residual stress and distortion predictions. This is one of the crucial steps in AM process optimization, but is computationally expensive, often requiring the use of large computer clusters.  The primary bottleneck in elasto-plastic simulation is the repeated solution of large linear systems of equations. While there is a wide range of linear solvers, most cannot exploit the unique structured nature of the mesh underlying AM simulation. Here, we revisit a specific matrix-free solver, namely rigid-body deflated solver that has been successfully deployed for solving large linear elastic problems in such scenarios. The salient feature of this solver is that the stiffness matrix is never assembled, thereby reducing the memory requirements significantly, leading to large computational gains.  The objective of this paper is to extend the above solver to elasto-plasticity by efficiently updating the element tangent stiffness matrices, and the corresponding deflation matrix. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated on a benchmark problem using multi-core CPU and GPU architectures, and compared against ANSYS. Then, part-level residual stresses and distortion are predicted using the proposed solver. The present work is restricted to associative plasticity with von-Mises yield criteria, but can be extended to other plasticity models.},

  abstract = {This paper provides insights into the effect of high thermal gradients and cooling rates on equiaxed grain nucleation and growth in conditions similar to those experienced during Additive Manufacturing (AM) processes. Bridgman type solidification is numerically simulated with columnar grains growing at a fixed pull rate under a user-imposed thermal gradient. Controlled inoculants of known nucleation undercooling were placed ahead of the growing columnar grains to allow quantitative analysis of nucleation events. At low thermal gradient and cooling rate only the inoculants with low nucleation undercooling were activated due to low melt undercooling driven by constitutional supercooling (CS). As the cooling rate is increased, for a given thermal gradient, a larger number of inoculants with higher nucleation undercoolings were activated. At higher cooling rates, thermal undercooling was generated by a lag in the growth rate of the solid-liquid (S-L) interface compared to the theoretical pull rate. Thus, thermal undercooling becomes dominant leading to the facilitation of nucleation on less potent substrates requiring higher undercooling. The results show a transition from solute-driven undercooling to cooling rate driven thermal undercooling which contributes to the undercooling that activates the nucleation events. Invoking the Interdependence model, it is also shown that the high cooling rate induced thermal undercooling reduces the size of the nucleation free zone substantially.},

A primary focus was to evaluate the influence of material constitutive models on predicted mechanical behaviors. Johnson-Cook (JC) constitutive material models were chosen to account for the contribution of strain, strain rate, and temperature on material responses. Three different modifications of the JC models were applied to assess the sensitivity of rate hardening and temperature-dependent strain hardening on mechanical prediction. Numerical results revealed that predicted stress and strain fields were highly sensitive to the rate-dependent term but minimally affected by the temperature-dependent strain hardening. The maximum differences in average stresses and plastic strains were 23\% and 13\% when comparing results between the JC model and the JC model without the strain rate hardening, respectively. Moreover, it was found that strain rate hardening mostly occurred at intermediate temperatures, {$\approx$}1000 \textendash{} 1600 K, during the continuous cooling phase. Finally, the present study emphasizes the importance of material constitutive models on mechanical behavior in laser powder bed fusion as well as providing insight for further exploration of process parameter optimization.},

Uniform scan strategies with scan lengths of 0.5, 1, and 2\,mm were applied so that wide ranges of thermal histories could be generated. The Johnson-Cook (JC) and Mechanical Threshold Stress (MTS) material plasticity models were chosen to capture the influence of strain, strain rate, and temperature. The JC model is a phenomenological model which is known for its easy implementation and excellent agreement with material testing results. On the other hand, the MTS model is a more complex physics-based internal state variable plasticity model that is expected to provide more accurate estimation, particularly for cases involving changes in strain rate and temperature. Numerical results revealed that both JC and MTS models provided a similar stress evolution, however, the plastic strain evolution was more realistic using the MTS model. Moreover, it was found that the maximum strain and the strain rate in the LPBF process are high compared to typical quasi-static testing, i.e., \textasciitilde 2\% and\,\textasciitilde\,4\,s-1, respectively. Accordingly, the material models should be calibrated with data obtained under similar deformation conditions. The choice of scan length also strongly affects in-plane stress anisotropy. Ultimately, we show both qualitatively and quantitatively the dependency of mechanical behavior prediction in LPBF on the choice of material models.},

Today, monitoring has been commercially applied to even the newest laser processes, e.g. additive manufacturing. For laser welding, the process monitoring has been developed even further and closed-loop systems have been demonstrated several years ago. The improvements in digital camera technology and data processing have resulted in development of systems that use feature recognition for determining certain features of the process.

A digital single lens reflex camera, mirror and several sets of light emitting diode strip lights formed the main constituents of the IMS. Cylindrical samples of 316\,L stainless steel were printed with variations in their energy density. Features taken in optical images were extracted and evaluated via image processing. Micro computed tomography (CT), which is capable of assessing the internal defects and recovering the 3D representation of a structure, was used as a validation method to correlate the features identified in the optical images. Results have shown that features captured in-situ were correlated to defects detected by micro CT, revealing the potential of using optical images captured during printing as an indicator to the extent of defects present in selective laser melted parts.},

This paper overviews the progress of applying the NN algorithm to several aspects of the AM whole chain, including model design, in situ monitoring, and quality evaluation. Current challenges in applying NNs to AM and potential solutions for these problems are then outlined.

Particularly, the stochastic formation of large spatters leads to unpredictable defects in the as-printed parts. Here we report the elimination of large spatters through controlling laser-powder bed interaction instabilities by using nanoparticles. The elimination of large spatters results in 3D printing of defect lean sample with good consistency and enhanced properties. We reveal that two mechanisms work synergistically to eliminate all types of large spatters: (1) nanoparticle-enabled control of molten pool fluctuation eliminates the liquid breakup induced large spatters; (2) nanoparticle-enabled control of the liquid droplet coalescence eliminates liquid droplet colliding induced large spatters. The nanoparticle-enabled simultaneous stabilization of molten pool fluctuation and prevention of liquid droplet coalescence discovered here provide a potential way to achieve defect lean metal additive manufacturing.},

  abstract = {Keyhole pore formation is one of the most detrimental subsurface defects in the laser metal additive manufacturing process. However, effective way to mitigate keyhole pore formation beyond tuning laser processing conditions during keyhole mode laser melting is still lacking. Here we report a novel approach to mitigate keyhole pore formation during laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) process by using stable nanoparticles. The critical keyhole depth for keyhole pore generation (i.e., the largest keyhole depth without keyhole pore formation) during LPBF of Al6061 increases from 246 \textmu m to 454 \textmu m (85\% increase) after adding TiC nanoparticles. In-depth x-ray imaging studies and thermo-fluid dynamics simulation enable us to identify that two mechanisms work together to mitigate keyhole pore generation: (1) adding nanoparticles prevents the keyhole from collapsing by increasing the liquid viscosity to impede the protrusion development; (2) adding nanoparticles slows down the keyhole pore movement by increasing the liquid viscosity, resulting in the recapturing of the pore by the keyhole. We further demonstrate that adding TiC nanoparticle can also eliminate the keyhole fluctuation induced keyhole pore during LPBF of Al6061. Our research provides a potential way to mitigate the keyhole pore formation for defect lean metal additive manufacturing.},

We describe a mathematical object, which we denote universal differential equations (UDEs), as the unifying framework connecting the ecosystem. We show how a wide variety of applications, from automatically discovering biological mechanisms to solving high-dimensional Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations, can be phrased and efficiently handled through the UDE formalism and its tooling.

  abstract = {Hot working tool steels (HWTS) are popular for industrial applications such as injection molding tools, and casting dies because of their high wear resistance, fatigue, strength, and toughness properties, even at elevated temperatures. Conventionally, they go through multi-stage heat treatments in order to attain targeted microstructures. Achieving such microstructures with a laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) process will require tailor-made process parameters since it is characterized by non-equilibrium conditions, non-uniform temperature distribution, and metastable phase formation. Recent advances in the LPBF qualification of 1.2343/4 HWTS have shown commendable results but are still fraught with the limitations of poor ductility or extra post-heat treatment steps. For the industrial competitiveness of LPBF HWTS, the enhancement of strength and ductility and elimination of post processing is critical. Therefore, minimizing retained austenite in the as-built samples through pre-heat treatment or alloying to reduce post heat treatments without sacrificing strength will be economically important for industry. In this work, 1.2343 HWTS and its modified form were LPBF printed both in the as-built, pre- and post-heat-treated conditions. The results are discussed based on the correlations of the powder properties with LPBF\textemdash part density, microstructure, and mechanical properties.},

  abstract = {Materials informatics employs techniques, tools, and theories drawn from the emerging fields of data science, internet, computer science and engineering, and digital technologies to the materials science and engineering to accelerate materials, products and manufacturing innovations. Manufacturing is transforming into shorter design cycles, mass customization, on-demand production, and sustainable products. Additive manufacturing or 3D printing is a popular example of such a trend. However, the success of this manufacturing transformation is critically dependent on the availability of suitable materials and of data on invertible processing\textendash structure\textendash property\textendash performance life cycle linkages of materials. Experience suggests that the material development cycle, i.e. the time to develop and deploy new material, generally exceeds the product design and development cycle. Hence, there is a need to accelerate materials innovation in order to keep up with product and manufacturing innovations. This is a major challenge considering the hundreds of thousands of materials and processes, and the huge amount of data on microstructure, composition, properties, and functional, environmental, and economic performance of materials. Moreover, the data sharing culture among the materials community is sparse. Materials informatics is key to the necessary transformation in product design and manufacturing. Through the association of material and information sciences, the emerging field of materials informatics proposes to computationally mine and analyze large ensembles of experimental and modeling datasets efficiently and cost effectively and to deliver core materials knowledge in user-friendly ways to the designers of materials and products, and to the manufacturers.

Metals are a popular choice among AM materials due to their superior properties, despite being more challenging to print. Reduced product cost, the possibility for quick production and prototyping, and the capability of a produced component by high accuracy in a broad variety of shapes, geometrical complexity, size, and material are all advantages of metal AM technology. Metal fused deposition modeling (metal FDM) is a relatively new technique based on the widely used FDM process. It is a relatively low-cost competitor to other metal AM techniques such as selective laser melting (SLM). This review paper has explored the most recently issued publications in this extrusion-based metal additive manufacturing (EAM) technique. The main parameters in feedstock preparation, deposition and 3D printing, debinding, and sintering phases of the metal FDM process will be discussed and their influence on the mechanical and microstructural characteristics of the 3D-printed parts. Furthermore, the application of finite element modeling for metal FDM process analysis is explored. Finally, the challenges and gaps in the manufacturing of components and obtaining desired characteristics have been presented.},

As the raw material used is in powder form, particle size distribution (PSD) is a significant characteristic that influences the build quality in turn affecting the functionality and aesthetics aspects of the product. This paper investigates the effect of PSD on the printed geometry for 316L stainless steel powder, where three coupled in-house simulation tools based on Discrete Element Method (DEM), Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), and Structural Mechanics are employed. DEM is used for simulating the powder bed distribution based on the different powder PSD. The CFD is used as a virtual testbed to determine thermal parameters such as heat capacity and thermal conductivity of the powder bed viewed as a continuum. The values found as a stochastic function of the powder distribution is used to analyse the effect on the melted zone and deformation using Structural Mechanics. Results showed that mean particle size and PSD had a significant effect on the packing density, melt pool layer thickness, and the final layer thickness after deformation. Specifically, a narrow particle size distribution with smaller mean particle size and standard deviation produced solidified final layer thickness closest to nominal layer thickness. The proposed simulation approach and the results will catalyze in development of geometry assurance strategies to minimize the effect of particle size distribution on the geometric quality of the printed part.},

The prediction is achieved by utilizing the Buckingham-{$\Pi$} theorem and the implementation of Pawlowski's matrix transformation method. The universality of the new dimensionless numbers is verified by applying them to selective laser melting data for eight different metals and alloy systems, obtained both experimentally and gathered from the literature. The dimensionless numbers allow for identification of process parameters that will result in a maximum density regime in the as-built part. Finally, a universal scaling law is introduced that can aid in quantitative prediction of process parameters that result in the highest as-built density.},

However, few instances of manufactured optimized designs are documented, and even fewer examples of experimentally-tested designs are available. The lack of validation combined with the influence of AM process on material properties leaves a gap in our understanding of process-microstructure-property relationships that is essential for developing holistic design optimization frameworks. In this work, a functional design was topologically optimized and fabricated using both directed energy deposition (DED) and selective laser melting (SLM) methods. This is the first direct comparison of these AM methods in the context of TO. Mechanical properties of SS316L and the optimized components in as-fabricated and heat-treated conditions were investigated under uniaxial displacement-controlled tensile loading and compared to finite element modeling (FEM) predictions. Optimized samples provided regions of both compressive and tensile loading in the test specimen. Experimental results showed the FEM predictions to be conservative. Microstructural analysis revealed that this difference is due to refined microstructures formed during the additive manufacturing process that strengthen the material in regions with high stress levels. Moreover, SLM samples showed higher yield strength compared to DED samples due to a more refined grain size and denser dislocation structures. TO results are sensitive to the AM method, post-processing conditions, and differences in mechanical properties. Thus, a TO for AM framework can be best optimized with the incorporation of microstructure features to account for localized microstructural variations in fabricated components.},

A fundamental possibility to obtain compact samples by powder bed fusion using a laser beam (PBF-LB) from Ti25Zr25Ni25Co10Cu15 powder obtained by mechanical alloying and plasma spheroidization is shown. During PBF-LB, a mixed structure is formed. It consists of B2-TiNi-type austenite with Laves phases and zirconium oxides. The average grain size is around 5~{$\mu$}m. The hardness of the alloy produced is more than 600 HV and significantly exceeds that of the alloy produced by conventional techniques. The ultimate compressive strength and the compressive yield strength of the samples are 640~MPa, and 600~MPa, respectively, meaning the synthesized samples are significantly inferior to the alloys produced by conventional smelting technologies. However, the ductility of 1.3\% is comparable to that of similar alloys and indicates potential prospects of PBF-LB to manufacture Ti\textendash Zr\textendash Ni\textendash Co\textendash Cu HEAs.},

Data which is obtained from a multivariate sensor system in-situ must be analyzed automatically to ensure an early and reliable detection of defects to reduce the costs due to production scrap. For that reason, a modular anomaly detector for multivariate time series in WAAM was investigated in this paper. The approach adressed major topics in real-life data sets of industrial applications such as miscellaneous signal sample rates, lack of synchronization and concept drift. A reference data set based on an anomaly-dependently splitted time horizon was defined to reduce the sensitivity loss of the detector after an anomaly. To avoid the need for labeled data, an unsupervised anomaly detection method based on neural networks was used. Hence, no time and costs for artificial defect creation on the machine tool are required when implementing the approach in industrial applications.},

  abstract = {Direct metal laser solidification (DMLS) has been receiving increasing research interest in the additive manufacturing (AM) industry due to its outstanding performance in producing parts with ultra-high precision and variable geometries. However, the lack of appropriate in-situ disturbance detection techniques specialized for DMLS makes real-time quality control extremely difficult. In this work, a first-principles-based finite element method (FEM) model focusing on the heat transfer behavior of the DMLS process is developed. The model-produced thermal data is processed to reproduce the outputs of two industrially used sensors: the optical tomography (OT) sensor and the melt pool monitoring (MPM) sensor. In-situ sensor data analytics is then performed through the use of a convolutional neural network (CNN) to automatically detect disturbances from each sensor data during the build process in real-time. Transfer learning is applied to the pre-trained AlexNet backbone to efficiently construct the disturbance detection CNNs for each sensor, and overall accuracy of 73.4\% and 82.8\% is observed for the melt pool and the OT CNN, respectively. To further increase the accuracy, a cross-validation scheme is proposed to combine the results from both CNNs based on their confidence levels. The final results demonstrate that the testing accuracy increases to 90.4\% when cross-validation between both sensor data analytics is applied. The developed machine-learning-based algorithms provides a methodology to perform real-time process data analytics and thereby reducing defect formation and increasing production throughput.}

Hence, optimizing process parameters to maintain a constant melt-pool size during the build process could potentially improve the build quality of the final part. This paper considers the optimal control of laser power, while keeping other process parameters fixed, to achieve a constant melt-pool size during the laser scanning of a multi-track build under L-PBF. First, Gaussian process regression (GPR) is applied to model the dynamic evolution of the melt-pool size as a function of laser power and thermal history, which are defined as the input features of the GPR model. Then a constrained finite-horizon optimal control problem is formulated, with a quadratic cost function defined to minimize the difference between the controlled melt-pool size and its reference value. A projected gradient descent algorithm is applied to compute the optimal sequence of laser power in the proposed control problem. The GPR modeling is demonstrated using simulated data sets, a mix of simulated and experimental data sets, or pure experimental data sets. Numerical verification of the control design of laser power is performed on a commercial AM software, Autodesk's Netfabb Simulation. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed GPR modeling and model-based optimal control in regulating the melt-pool size during the scanning of multi-tracks using L-PBF.},

Selective laser melting is one of these technologies offering large potentials in the production of complex and flexible metal products. As the technology is relatively new, it is vulnerable for errors, given that the process parameters are not measured yet. A novel multilevel control concept, incorporating several sensors, has the potential to reduce errors significantly. For inner cascade control, the laser power will be adjusted by measurements with an intensity sensor for wavelengths in the visible range. This sensor is integrated into the optical path of the laser beam. An adapted self-learning strategy supports the stability of the process by updating the parameters of the used multidimensional model in order to attenuate environmental influences or shifts within the process. This work presents the concept of the control approach, first measurement results and the required relations between measurement, process and control parameters.},

The process parameters used to manufacture a wide variety of components are currently kept constant and closed-loop controls are missing. However, due to the part geometry that causes varying heat flow to neighbouring powder and solidified sections or due to deviations in the atmosphere caused by fumes within the work area, there are changes in the melt pool temperature. These deviations are not considered by system control, so far. It is, therefore, advisable to measure the melt temperature with sensors and to regulate the process. This work presents an approach that enables fast process control of the melt pool temperature and combines a closed-loop control strategy with a feedforward approach. The control strategies are tested by proof-of-concept experiments on a bridge geometry and partly powder-filled steel plates. Furthermore, results of a finite element simulation are used to validate the experimental results. Combining closed-loop and feedforward control reduces the temperature deviation by up to 90\%. This helps to prevent construction errors and increases the part quality.},

A physics-informed approach is adopted to define input features for the machine-learning models, and a two-level architecture is defined for the model training and validation. Specifically, a so-called initial (pre-deposition) temperature at the deposition point is identified as one key variable in characterizing thermal history for predicting melt-pool sizes. At the lower-level of the two-level modeling architecture, a hybrid model consisting of an analytical computation and a Gaussian process is developed to predict the pre-deposition temperature using process input parameters. Then at the higher-level of the modeling architecture, eight machine learning algorithms (including machine-learning based regression models and a two-layer neural network) are evaluated in predicting melt-pool volumes using the pre-deposition temperature and process parameters. For this proof-of-concept study, simulation data generated from the Autodesk Netfabb Local Simulation are used for model training and validation.

It is an extension of the gas-kinetic DG method proposed by the authors for static domains (X. Ren et al., 2015 [22]). A moving mesh gas kinetic DG method is proposed for both inviscid and viscous flow computations. A flux integration method across a translating and deforming cell interface has been constructed. Differently from the previous ALE-type gas kinetic method with piecewise constant mesh velocity at each cell interface within each time step, the mesh velocity variation inside a cell and the mesh moving and rotating at a cell interface have been accounted for in the finite element framework. As a result, the current scheme is applicable for any kind of mesh movement, such as translation, rotation, and deformation. The accuracy and robustness of the scheme have been improved significantly in the oscillating airfoil calculations. All computations are conducted in a physical domain rather than in a reference domain, and the basis functions move with the grid movement. Therefore, the numerical scheme can preserve the uniform flow automatically, and satisfy the geometric conservation law (GCL). The numerical accuracy can be maintained even for a largely moving and deforming mesh. Several test cases are presented to demonstrate the performance of the gas-kinetic DG-ALE method.},

Due to the difficulty of observing laser reflections, current understanding on the laser reflection mechanisms is still vague and unclear. This work constructs a high-fidelity CFD model coupled with a ray-tracing method to visualize the flow kinetics and reflection behavior during SLM Cu-Cr-Zr alloy. Considering the material specificity of copper, a temperature-dependent absorption rule is introduced to overcome the simulation deviation caused by the widely-used Fresnel absorption, showing good agreement with experiments in terms of track width and depth. The in-situ absorptivity measurement experiments are further conducted to compare with simulations with the error less than 2\%. Additionally, different reflection mechanisms for continuous and distorted tracks are revealed. At relatively high linear energy density (LED), the global absorptivity undergoes a rise and a decrease in the initial stage, and finally gets stable. At low LED level, the surface tension drives the melt pool to form isolated balls and exposed plat surface, which is responsible for the intense absorptivity oscillation as the balling effect occurs.},

As melt-pool characteristics such as melt-pool size and dimensions are highly correlated with porosity and defects in the fabricated parts, it is crucial to predict how process parameters would affect the melt-pool size and dimensions during the build process to ensure the build quality. This paper presents a two-level machine learning (ML) model to predict the melt-pool size during the scanning of a multi-track build.

Despite the numerous advantages of this technology, inconsistency in the microstructure and, consequently, the mechanical properties of the fabricated components in the building direction makes it quite challenging to obtain uniform parts in the as-built state. This issue originates from the layer-by-layer melt pool temperature variation caused by the layer-wise nature of this process when a fixed set of process parameters is applied. Accordingly, a layer-wise melt pool temperature control system is beneficial in manipulating the process parameters and therefore adjusting the melt pool temperature. In this study, three different controllers, namely, simple proportional (P), adaptive P, and sliding mode, were designed to control the melt pool temperature in the building direction for Inconel 625 superalloy. An analytical-experimental model was introduced to evaluate the performance of controllers through simulation. A monitoring system having a two-color pyrometer was used to online monitor the temperature for use by the controllers as a feedback signal. The microstructure and microhardness of the final products were evaluated prior to and after employing the melt pool temperature controllers. Compared to the scenario with constant process parameters, the implementation of these controllers led to improved microhardness and microstructure uniformity, resulting from the reduced variation in the primary dendrite arm spacing. The lessons learned from this study can assist in the fabrication of functionally graded materials with engineered microstructures.},

The second set of experiments analysed the effect of varying laser power for a constant heat source separation distance. The results demonstrate that the distance between the two heat sources significantly affects the cooling rates. The calculated results showed that the hybrid weld pool was very well mixed with strong convection currents resulting from the interaction between the electromagnetic and Marangoni forces. The calculated and experimental results showed that hybrid welding increases the weld pool width and gap bridgability when compared with laser welding. The weld pool depth in hybrid welding was affected mainly by the characteristics of the laser beam. Hybrid weld pool penetration depth is maximised at an optimal distance between the arc electrode and laser beam. The cooling rate increases significantly when the heat sources are separated beyond a critical distance. At close separation between arc and laser, calculations show that the arc radius must be decreased to achieve the observed weld depths.},

Microstructure evolution was analysed by means of electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD). Different substrate plate temperatures lead to differences in microstructure evolution due to the prevailing cooling conditions and overall thermal history, eventually resulting in different hardening behavior under quasi-static tensile loading even if the general mechanical performance of the different conditions is very similar. From the results shown, it is deduced that the prevailing microstructures are a result of different internal stress states evolved during solidification, cooling and intrinsic heat treatment, respectively. The different internal stress states promote increased local orientation deviations within the grains, which can be rationalized by different dislocation densities. The monotonic strength of the steel in focus is outstanding compared with cold-rolled counterparts and data available in literature.},

  abstract = {The present paper aims to generate a deeper understanding of the influence of powder properties on the final parts manufactured by metal LPBF processes at constant parameter settings, except the hatch scanning speed. This issue was considered using four different AlSi10Mg powders.    In addition to particle properties, such as particle size distribution and morphology, typical properties of the powder feedstock like bulk and tapped density, Hausner-Ratio, flowability and laser absorption were measured. Furthermore, the in situ density of the powder layers applied during the LPBF process were analyzed. A comparison of the surface quality, part density and mechanical properties of AlSi10Mg parts produced by LPBF, using different particle size distributions and morphologies, has been conducted. Within the processing experiments, the laser scanning speed was varied in order to achieve the most economical manufacturing of parts with a density {$>$} 99.2 \%.    Following this comparison, it was found that the manufacturing process of the powder and therefore the particle morphology has the biggest impact on the part density and surface quality. The considered plasma atomized powder could be processed at a higher scanning speed without a significant decrease in mechanical properties or part density. Generally, it was shown that higher densities of the powder layer result in higher part densities. However, the layer densities for powders which show almost the same bulk density can differ significantly and do not reach the regarding bulk density value. Therefore it can be stated that the layer density is not only affected by the bulk density. In terms of surface quality, the investigated plasma atomized powder provides a significantly lower surface roughness.    Moreover, it was found that the measurement of the laser absorption shows a strong correlation to the achievable part densities. In contrast to the other methods performed, it was the only measurement that is very sensitive even to small variations of the powder and enables an unequivocal differentiation of the examined powders.}

  abstract = {Highly reinforced 316\,L / SiCp metal matrix composites (MMC) walls have been additively manufactured by Direct Laser Deposition (DLD) using mixtures with different percentages of 316\,L stainless steel powder and SiC particles (SiCp). The effect of the percentages of SiCp of up to 80\,wt.\% and DLD conditions on the geometry, microstructure, and hardness of the fabricated structures have been analyzed. SiC particles react with the molten 316\,L steel and chromium and iron carbides are formed, and also graphite flakes and nodules are formed in the matrix. This reaction is also responsible for the dilution of the SiCp, which lose their initial shape and size. The incorporation of higher percentages of SiCp reduces the degradation of the particles as the matrix saturates in Si and C, and also enhances the size of the graphite precipitated phases. The different phases formed help to increase the hardness of the composites, and a maximum value of 1085 HV0.1 was obtained for 40\,vol.\% of SiCp. Increasing further the amount of SiCp reduced the hardness to values of {$\sim$}890 HV0.1 as the matrix is saturated in carbides and bigger and more brittle graphite precipitates are formed. The characteristics of the manufactured samples for the different reinforcement percentages used and for the different manufacturing conditions have been analyzed. From this study, the DLD processing maps for the 316\,L/SiC MMC metal matrix composites with different content of reinforcement have been developed, and the optimal values of laser power, scanning speed, and layer height have been determined, and it has been observed that the optimum fabrication conditions displace to lower scanning speed for higher SiCp contents in the 316\,L matrix. Showing that it is possible to manufacture cermets based on steel with lower density and greater hardness than the steel used.},

This spatter consisted of large, spherical particles, highly dendritic surfaces, particles with caps of accreted liquid, and agglomerations of multiple individual particles fixed together by liquid ligaments. The focus of this study is on an additional, unique spatter morphology consisting of larger, spherical particles with surface oxide spots exhibiting a wide distribution of surface configurations, including organized patterning. Spatter particles with organized surface oxide patterns were characterized for surface and internal particle features using multiple imaging techniques. The following observations are made: 1) spots resided at the spatter particle surface and did not significantly penetrate the interior, 2) the spot(s) were amorphous and rich in Silicon (Si)-Manganese (Mn)-Oxygen (O), 3) a two-part Chromium (Cr)-O rich layer exists between the particle and spot, 4) Cr-O rich morphological features were present at the top surface of the spots, 5) the spatter particle composition was consistent with 316\,L but appeared to decrease in Si content into the spatter particle away from a spot, and 6) small Si-rich spherical particles existed within the spatter particle interior.}

However, microstructures generated from AM processes can be equally, if not more, complex than their conventionally processed counterparts. While some microstructural features observed in AM may also occur in more traditional solidification processes, the introduction of spatially and temporally mobile heat sources can result in significant microstructural heterogeneity. While grain size and shape in metal AM structures are understood to be highly dependent on both local and global temperature profiles, the exact form of this relation is not well understood. Here, an idealized molten zone and temperature-dependent grain boundary mobility are implemented in a kinetic Monte Carlo model to predict three-dimensional grain structure in additively manufactured metals. To demonstrate the flexibility of the model, synthetic microstructures are generated under conditions mimicking relatively diverse experimental results present in the literature. Simulated microstructures are then qualitatively and quantitatively compared to their experimental complements and are shown to be in good agreement.},

We present a three-dimensional model that simulates both solidification and solid-state evolution phenomena using stochastic Monte Carlo and Potts Monte Carlo methods. The model also incorporates a finite-difference based thermal conduction solver to create a fully integrated microstructural prediction tool. The three modeling methods and their coupling are described and demonstrated for a model study of laser powder-bed fusion of 300-series stainless steel.

These unique microstructures partially account for the massive property disparity existing between AM and conventionally processed alloys. Although equiaxed grains are desirable for isotropic mechanical behavior, the columnar-to-equiaxed transition remains difficult to predict for conventional solidification processes, and much more so for AM. In this study, the effects of laser intensity profile ellipticity on melt track macrostructures and microstructures were studied in 316L stainless steel. Experimental results were supported by temperature gradients and melt velocities simulated using the ALE3D multi-physics code. As a general trend, columnar grains preferentially formed with increasing laser power and scan speed for all beam profiles. However, when conduction mode laser heating occurs, scan parameters that result in coarse columnar microstructures using Gaussian profiles produce equiaxed or mixed equiaxed-columnar microstructures using elliptical profiles. By modulating spatial laser intensity profiles on the fly, site-specific microstructures and properties can be directly engineered into additively manufactured parts.},

  abstract = {Grain growth in the wake of the melt pool formed during alloy-based Additive Manufacturing (AM) is complex and multifaceted, depending on parameters governing heat transport, fluid flow, and solidification itself. Cellular automata (CA) models have proven effective in providing computationally efficient and physically sound predictions of grain structure for several AM problems, but their efficiency is tied to the performance of heat transport models. CA models use only a small portion of the problem's temperature data (near the moving melt pool boundary), and much of the CA calculations do not affect the final result due to re-melting of material. Coupling of and communication between heat transport and solidification models, and eliminating operations irrelevant towards final grain structure prediction, will be necessary for using these methods for efficient simulation of large parts. We introduce a procedure of decoupling the CA from temperature field simulation, using files of relevant temperature data written by the heat transport model. This approach is validated against the standard coupling approach using data obtained through the computational fluid dynamics software OpenFOAM. Negligible differences are seen in grain size, volume, and texture distributions for multilayer simulation of test problems. Variability in microstructure as a function of cell size, substrate, time step, and nucleation parameters is studied, and it is found that cell sizes less than or equal to 1.67 \$\textbackslash mu\$m and sufficiently small time steps yield statistically equivalent microstructures. Finally, a potential use case for this CA approach \textendash{} the layer-wise convergence in grain structure starting from extremes in initial grain size \textendash{} is examined. This approach's ability to simulate expected trends in nucleation and epitaxial grain growth for large regions of microstructure, simulated independently of heat transport models themselves, should prove useful for investigation of various microstructure uncertainties and prediction of part-scale experimental results.}

The OpenFOAM model for process conditions, the ExaCA model for as-solidified grain structure, and the ExaConstit model for constitutive mechanical properties are used as part of the ExaAM modeling framework to examine a few of the various sources of uncertainty in the modeling workflow. In addition to ``random'' uncertainty (due to random number generation in the orientations and locations of grains present), the heterogeneous nucleation density N0 and the mean substrate grain spacing S0 are varied to examine their impact of grain area development as a function of build height in the simulated microstructure. While mean grain area after 1 mm of build is found to be sensitive to N0 and S0, particularly at small N0 and large S0 (despite some convergence toward similar values), the resulting grain shapes and overall textures develop in a reasonably similar manner. As a result of these similar textures, ExaConstit simulation using ExaCA representative volume elements (RVEs) from various permutations of N0, S0, and location within the build resulted in similar yield stress, stress\textendash strain curve shape, and stress triaxiality distributions. It is concluded that for this particular material and scan pattern, 15 layers is sufficient for ExaCA texture and ExaConstit predicted properties to become relatively independent of additional layer simulation, provided that reasonable estimates for N0 and S0 are used. However, additional layers of ExaCA will need to be run to obtain mean grain areas independent of build height and baseplate structure.},

As-built material was heat treated to selectively remove microstructural features such as melt pool boundaries, microsegregations and the as-built grain structure to evaluate their influence on yield and failure behaviour. Anisotropic yield behaviour was found to be caused by microstructural features alone and not influenced by porosity. However, ductility and failure were dominated by lack of fusion porosity. The alignment of pores between tracks along layer boundaries was found to cause anisotropic ductility. Three strengthening mechanisms in as-built material were identified as grain boundaries, chemical segregation and dislocation density. Heat treatments were categorised into three regimes: recovery, homogenisation and annealing. The findings of this study show that the shape, size, orientation and distribution of pores are crucial parameters for evaluating the structural integrity of parts produced by laser powder bed fusion.},

In the present work, we employ laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF) to examine the feasibility of using Ti as the main strengthening, L12-forming element for the design of a well-processable, precipitation-strengthened model alloy. Al-1.76Ti and Al-2.51Ti (wt\%) alloys with and without ternary additions of Ni and Si are fabricated during processing from powder mixtures. Crack-free microstructures are produced, which display alternating fine- and coarse-grained regions. During heat treatment, one of the investigated alloys, Al-2.51Ti-0.7Si, exhibits an ageing response due to the formation of nanoscale, metastable L12-(Al,Si)3Ti precipitates, reaching a peak hardness of 97 HV. This demonstrates that L-PBF-processed Ti-containing aluminium alloys can exhibit a precipitation hardening response similar to alloys containing Sc or Zr. In the other Al-Ti-based materials tested, no significant hardness increase was found. This discrepancy is ascribed to the effects Si exerts on the precipitation process. First, the addition of Si increases the thermodynamic driving force for homogeneous nucleation of L12-Al3Ti precipitates. Secondly, Si-Ti co-clustering is observed by atom probe tomography, which is expected to enhance the otherwise sluggish diffusion of Ti. The Al-2.51Ti-0.7Si alloy developed in this work can in the future be further strengthened by adding additional alloying elements and by optimising the heat treatment.},

It has been successfully applied to study diverse micromechanical phenomena ranging from strain hardening in single crystals to texture evolution in polycrystalline aggregates.

Technologically important fields of application of enhanced CP models include phase transformations, hydrogen embrittlement, irradiation damage, fracture, and recrystallization. A number of niche tools, containing multi-physics extensions of the CP method, have been developed to address such topics.

With the D\"usseldorf Advanced Material Simulation Kit (DAMASK) we, therefore, undertake the effort to provide an open, flexible, and easy to use implementation to the scientific community that is highly modular and allows the use and straightforward implementation of different types of constitutive laws and numerical solvers. The internal modular structure of DAMASK follows directly from the hierarchy inherent to the employed continuum description. The highest level handles the partitioning of the prescribed field values on a material point between its underlying microstructural constituents and the subsequent homogenization of the constitutive response of each constituent. The response of each microstructural constituent is determined, at the intermediate level, from the time integration of the underlying constitutive laws for elasticity, plasticity, damage, phase transformation, and heat generation among other coupled multi-physical processes of interest. Various constitutive laws based on evolving internal state variables can be implemented to provide this response at the lowest level. DAMASK already contains various CP-based models to describe metal plasticity as well as constitutive models to incorporate additional effects such as heat production and transfer, damage evolution, and athermal transformations. Furthermore, the implementation of additional constitutive laws and homogenization schemes, as well as the integration of a wide class of suitable boundary and initial value problem solvers, is inherently considered in its modular design.},

The method is developed for austenitic stainless steels, on which a wealth of data are availble as various conditions for crack and pore/defect formation have been reported. The model is based on an alloy design approach combining thermodynamic calculations with a genetic algorithm to discover novel austenitic stainless steel compositions; the new alloys are expected to be crack-free whilst showing improved strength. A new crack prevention factor is proposed to relate composition to solidification crack formation. The factor incoporates quantitative criteria for the solidification temperature range, the performance index (ratio between yield stress and coefficient of thermal expansion) and the solidificaiton path. Overall, the design methodology is validated by literature data on 316L austenitic stainless steel. Although cracking is not an issue during LPBF of 316L stainless steel, this material is a good choice to show under which conditions the cracks form. As for porosity and defect prevention, it is shown how this can be achieved by providing a sufficient amount of energy to melt the powder bed, and by controlling the melt pool geometry; such criteria are dissimilar to those reported in the literature. Process maps have been developed to show the effects of process parameters on the formation of pores and defects based on the proposed criteria. The model is applied to optimise such parameters to produce 316L austenitic stainless steel, and it is shown that a defect-free LPBFed stainless steel can be achieved, performing better under tensile testing compared to its wrought counterpart. The conditions for the application of such model to other alloy families displaying cracking, such as marageing steels and nickel alloys, are discussed.},

  abstract = {A new approach to modelling the microstructure evolution and yield strength in laser powder bed fusion components is introduced. Restoration mechanisms such as discontinuous dynamic recrystallization, continuous dynamic recrystallization and dynamic recovery were found to be activated during laser powder bed fusion of austenitic stainless steels; these are modelled both via classical Zener-Hollomon and thermostatistical approaches. A mechanism is suggested for the formation of dislocation cells from solidification cells and dendrites, and their further transformation to low-angle grain boundaries to form subgrains. This occurs due to dynamic recovery during laser powder bed fusion. The yield strength is successfully modelled via a Hall-Petch-type relationship in terms of the subgrain size, instead of the actual grain size or the dislocation cell size. The validated Hall-Petch-type equation for austenitic stainless steels provides a guideline for the strengthening of laser powder bed fusion alloys with subgrain refinement, via increasing the low-angle grain boundary fraction (grain boundary engineering). To obtain higher strength, dynamic recovery should be promoted as the main mechanism to induce low-angle grain boundaries. The dependency of yield stress on process parameters and alloy composition is quantitatively described.},

  abstract = {NiTi alloys are a remarkable class of materials capable of exhibiting unique behaviors such as shape memory effect and superelasticity. Laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF), as one of the most prominent additive manufacturing processes, has been recently used by many researchers to fabricate high-quality NiTi alloys with desired properties. In this research, those findings were exploited to utilize an optimum range of volumetric energy density to produce dense parts and offer new insights into the microstructure and properties of the fabricated parts. Although the development of high residual stresses has been frequently reported, the effects of those stresses on the microstructural evolution of NiTi parts during the process have been rarely discussed. By utilizing finite element and analytical approaches, it was predicted that the driving force for the activation of restoration mechanisms, namely dynamic recovery and recrystallization, is provided at elevated temperatures, and the temperature range in which those mechanisms occur was calculated. Detailed microstructural investigations confirmed the results, revealing columnar grains along the building direction with strong substructures caused by dynamic recovery, in addition to new recrystallized grains at boundaries of the melt pools and scanned tracks. It was concluded that dynamic recovery acts as the dominant restoration mechanism during L-PBF of NiTi alloys, affecting both the microstructure and mechanical properties of the final part. Additionally, the peak temperature of the melt pool is a paramount factor that, if increased, results in further progress of the dynamic recovery mechanisms.},

In this process, a high-power laser beam scans the powder bed in a user-defined path to fuse the powder material in a layer by layer fashion. The quality of the build parts in this process depends on the consolidation kinetics which is directly influenced by the process parameters. In the present investigation, a mesoscale base phase-field model was developed to understand the consolidation kinetics of AlSi10Mg alloy powders in this process with varying laser power i.e., 70\,W, 100\,W, and 130\,W by keeping a constant scan speed of 100\,mm/s. From the simulation results, it was observed that the consolidation of powder particles occurs due to the diffusion mechanism. The diffusion rate and neck width increase with an increase in laser energy and finally remain constant which confirms the completion of the fusion of powder particles in this process.}

Using additive manufacturing technologies, and more specifically the laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF) process, allows designing highly complex parts such as compact and efficient CuCrZr heat exchangers. Additional understanding of the specific CuCrZr metallurgy during this manufacturing process is still needed to fully take advantages of these possibilities. This work aimed (i) to clarify the impact of the L-PBF process and post-fabrication heat treatments on the microstructure of L-PBF CuCrZr alloy, (ii) to determine the corresponding mechanical and electrical properties and (iii) to quantify the contributions of the different nano-scale strengthening mechanisms (nano-precipitation, dislocations, solid solution, grain size refinement) depending on the different heat treatments. The microstructures of the CuCrZr samples are carefully analyzed at different scales thanks to scanning electron and transmission electron microscopy, highlighting the effect of the different heat treatments. In all heat-treated samples, Cr nano-precipitates are uniformly dispersed in the Cu matrix; few Zr nano-precipitates are observed either at grain boundaries, next to Cr nano-precipitates, or inside the Cu matrix. Moreover, the mean grain size, dislocation density, mean radius and volume fraction of the Chromium nano-precipitates are measured. These data are introduced in the identified hardening mechanisms to estimate the yield strengths (YS) of the different analyzed CuCrZr microstructures. The results are compared to the experimental values, including those of a reference wrought heat-treated CuCrZr, and discussed. A good correlation is found between calculated and experimental values. For the first time, the main hardening mechanisms of L-PBF CuCrZr are quantified and the interest of the ``L-PBF~+~Direct Age Hardening (DAH)'' process route to get a high amount of Cr nano-precipitates is confirmed. The DAH applied to L-PBF materials provides high mechanical properties (184 HV1 hardness, YS~=~527~MPa, UTS~=~585MPa) while keeping a good elongation (14\%) and electrical conductivity (42\,MS. m-1). These results are due to a combination between (i) a high Cr nano-precipitates density, leading to a high precipitation hardening, and (ii) a high dislocation density associated to the presence of remaining solidification cells.},

  abstract = {There is an increasing need for the use of additive manufacturing (AM) to produce improved critical application engineering components. However, the materials manufactured using AM perform well below their traditionally manufactured counterparts, particularly for creep and fatigue. Research has shown that this difference in performance is due to the complex relationships between AM process parameters which affect the material microstructure and consequently the mechanical performance as well. Therefore, it is necessary to understand the impact of different AM build parameters on the mechanical performance of parts. Machine learning (ML) models are able to find hidden relationships in data using iterative statistical analyses and have the potential to develop process\textendash structure\textendash property\textendash performance relationships for manufacturing processes, including AM. The aim of this work is to apply ML techniques to materials testing data in order to understand the effect of AM process parameters on the creep rate of additively built nickel-based superalloy and to predict the creep rate of the material from these process parameters. In this work, the predictive capabilities of ML and its ability to develop process\textendash structure\textendash property relationships are applied to the creep properties of laser powder bed fused alloy 718. The input data for the ML model included the Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF) build parameters used\textemdash build orientation, scan strategy and number of lasers\textemdash and geometrical material descriptors which were extracted from optical microscope porosity images using image analysis techniques. The ML model was used to predict the minimum creep rate of the Laser Powder Bed Fused alloy 718 samples, which had been creep tested at 650 {$\smwhtcircle$}C and 600 MPa. The ML model was also used to identify the most relevant material descriptors affecting the minimum creep rate of the material (determined by using an ensemble feature importance framework). The creep rate was accurately predicted with a percentage error of 1.40\% in the best case. The most important material descriptors were found to be part density, number of pores, build orientation and scan strategy. These findings show the applicability and potential of using ML to determine and predict the mechanical properties of materials fabricated via different manufacturing processes, and to find process\textendash structure\textendash property relationships in AM. This increases the readiness of AM for use in critical applications.},

The method is able to significantly reduce spurious currents (almost to machine accuracy) for a stationary droplet, showing second order convergence both for the curvature and the interface shape. Accurate results are also obtained for additional test cases such as translating droplets, capillary oscillations and rising bubbles, for which numerical results are comparable to what obtained by other numerical codes in the same conditions. Finally, the Height Functions method is extended to include the treatment of contact angles, both for sessile droplets and droplets suspended under the effect of gravity, showing a very good agreement with the theoretical prediction.

  abstract = {Process monitoring and modelling can contribute to fostering the industrial relevance of additive manufacturing. Process related temperature gradients and thermal inhomogeneities cause residual stresses, and distortions and influence the microstructure. Variations in wall thickness can cause heat accumulations. These occur predominantly in filigree part areas and can be detected by utilizing off-axis thermographic monitoring during the manufacturing process. In addition, numerical simulation models on the scale of whole parts can enable an analysis of temperature fields upstream to the build process. In a microscale domain, modelling of several exposed single hatches allows temperature investigations at a high spatial and temporal resolution. Within this paper, FEM-based micro- and macroscale modelling approaches as well as an experimental setup for thermographic monitoring are introduced. By discussing and comparing experimental data with simulation results in terms of temperature distributions both the potential of numerical approaches and the complexity of determining suitable computation time efficient process models are demonstrated. This paper contributes to the vision of adjusting the transient temperature field during manufacturing in order to improve the resulting part's quality by simulation based process design upstream to the build process and the inline process monitoring.},

  abstract = {Laser powder bed fusion is an additive manufacturing process that employs highly focused laser radiation for selective melting of a metal powder bed. This process entails a complex heat flow and thermal management that results in characteristic, often highly textured microstructures, which lead to mechanical anisotropy. In this study, high-energy X-ray diffraction experiments were carried out to illuminate the formation and evolution of microstructural features during LPBF. The nickel-base alloy Inconel~625 was used for in~situ experiments using a custom LPBF system designed for these investigations. The diffraction patterns yielded results regarding texture, lattice defects, recrystallization, and chemical segregation. A combination of high laser power and scanning speed results in a strong preferred crystallographic orientation, while low laser power and scanning speed showed no clear texture. The observation of a constant gauge volume revealed solid-state texture changes without remelting. They were related to in~situ recrystallization processes caused by the repeated laser scanning. After recrystallization, the formation and growth of segregations were deduced from an increasing diffraction peak asymmetry and confirmed by ex situ scanning transmission electron microscopy.},

  abstract = {Additive manufacturing (AM) offers unique possibilities in comparison to conventional manufacturing processes. For example, complex parts can be manufactured without tools. For metals, the most commonly used AM process is laser-powder bed fusion (L-PBF). The L-PBF process is prone to process disturbances, hence maintaining a consistent part quality remains an important subject within current research. An established indicator for quantifying process changes is the dimension of melt pools, which depends on the energy input and the cooling conditions. The melt pool geometry is normally measured manually in cross sections of solidified welding seams. This paper introduces a new approach for the automated visual measuring of melt pools in cross-sections of parts manufactured by L-PBF. The melt pools are first segmented in the images and are then measured. Since the melt pools have a heterogeneous appearance, segmentation with common digital image processing is difficult, deep learning was applied in this project. With the presented approach, the melt pools can be measured over the whole cross section of the specimen. Furthermore, remelted melt pools, which are only partly visible, are evaluated. With this automated approach, a high number of melt pools in each cross-section can be measured, which allows the examination of trends over the build direction in a specimen and results in better statistics. Furthermore, deviations in the energy input can be estimated via the measured melt pool dimensions.},

The case hardening steel 16MnCr5 is typically used and its material properties are well known and understood. However, the resulting material properties following the post-LPBF process sequence such as residual stress annealing, case hardening and hard finishing are widely unknown. This paper presents a study of processing 16MnCr5 with an EOS M270 LPBF-machine reaching 99.5 \% relative density and above. The resulting microstructure and hardness of the material is examined. Furthermore, the tensile strength as well as the gear-specific tooth root carrying capacity are studied. The results are compared to a conventionally processed material via continuous casting. It is shown that residual stress annealing widely compensates material anisotropy following the LPBF process. Material hardness in the as-built condition is increased up to 21 \% compared to a conventional material. The case hardening behavior shows a difference in the resulting case hardening depth in comparison to conventional material. The residual stresses measured at the surface after the case hardening show compressive stresses. Pulsator tests deliver a stress-cycle (S-N) curve from which the tooth root carrying capacity can be derived.},

In accordance to the conventional metal injection molding (MIM) process, the FDM process is used to produce green parts. The polymer is removed from these green parts in post-treatment steps to produce brown parts. Finally, the metal particles of the brown parts are sintered to produce the final components (white parts). During the sintering process, a shrinkage of about 20\% occurs in each spatial direction. However, due to the green parts produced in FDM, the shrinkage is influenced by the part orientation on the building platform and the strand deposition strategy. In this publication the BASF 3D Printing Solutions GmbH material Ultrafuse 316L is investigated. This material is a POM (polyoxymethylene) polymer filled with stainless steel (316L) particles which is available in the form of a filament. The investigations focus on the influence of material specific FDM processing parameters and the achievable properties of the white parts. For this purpose, tensile strength tests are carried out. During these investigations, the properties of the green parts are considered in order to produce high-quality white parts. The density of the green parts is used as an evaluation criterion to directly assess the part quality. Additionally, the possibility of producing partially filled component areas in FDM is being observed.},

  abstract = {The processing of conventional alloys by laser-based additive manufacturing can be challenging, particularly for alloys prone to hot cracking. However, additive manufacturing offers the possibility to produce novel alloys with improved properties, which cannot be achieved by other processing methods. Although several studies have demonstrated the positive influence of Zr addition on crack prevention of Al alloys tailored to additive manufacturing, its influence on the formation of strengthening precipitates in 2xxx alloys, remains largely unexplored. This work investigates the microstructure of a Zr-modified 2xxx AlCuMgZr alloy fabricated by laser powder bed fusion, with a particular emphasis on the precipitation of phases induced by the post-processing heat treatment, and their effects on mechanical properties. The Zr addition successfully allows the consolidation of crack-free, dense material ({$>$}99.5\%). The microstructure is characterized by fine, equiaxed grains (0.5\textendash 3~{$\mu$}m) which result from Al3Zr-induced grain nucleation, with the grain boundary covered in eutectic S-Al2CuMg. After optimized three-step heat treatment, nm-sized L12-Al3Zr as well as S-Al2CuMg rods strengthen the alloy, and lead to microhardness, young's modulus and yield strength of {$\sim$}1410~MPa, {$\sim$}82 GPa and {$\sim$}340~MPa, respectively. The results provide a basis for the understanding and further development of 2xxx alloys tailored to additive manufacturing.},

  abstract = {The pervasive adoption of laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) as an industrial manufacturing technique relies on the improvement of its repeatability, currently limited by the stochastic formation of flaws. Considering that large flaws can form randomly and despite the optimization of process parameters, an in-situ monitoring technique suitable for detecting deviations that originate these critical flaws is paramount. The redeposition of spatters on the build area has previously been identified as one of the factors responsible for the rise of internal flaws, but so far limited are the efforts towards their detection. This study aims to detect spatter redeposits via in-situ monitoring and to couple the detections to lack of fusion. For that, long-exposure near-infrared in-situ monitoring associated with image analysis is employed to determine the exact locations and quantify the incidence of spatter redeposits across three full builds performed at varying layer thicknesses. The existence and distribution of internal flaws is verified ex-situ by means of ultrasonic inspection and metallography. The formation of internal flaws is attributed to spatter redeposits after detailed characterization of size, particle and surface morphology of spatter and identification of particles with identical characteristics on the fracture surface in the adjacencies of lack of fusion. It is found that spatters preferentially redeposit on the adjacencies of the gas outlet, but that the affected portion of the build area and the prevalence of detections is heavily dependent on the powder layer thickness employed in the manufacturing process. The monitoring system setup preferentially acquires signal from spatters redeposited on print regions, making it particularly suitable for flaw detection.},

This approach provides the ability to design parts with inherent damping that can suppress vibration by 88-95\% compared to fully-fused counterparts, and the damping achieved is a product of only 1-4\% unfused powder volume. Inherent damping with LPBF has also addressed conventional shortcomings like manufacturing feasibility, high cycle fatigue (HCF) endurance, and a predictive tool that helps optimize damping by configuring unfused powder volumes. Despite the proven capability of the approach, a threshold unfused powder volume for optimizing damping performance and minimizing structural integrity impact has not been identified. The work in this manuscript addresses this gap in the inherent damping with LPBF capability by leveraging damping data from a varied collection of Nickel Alloy 718 and Stainless Steel 316L specimens and assessing the trend in vibration suppression with respect to unfused powder volume. Results from this study show a trend in the effects of unfused powder volume on inherent damping performance. With the application of regression and probability distribution analyses, a rule-of-thumb comparison between undamped and passively damped systems has allowed for systemic identification of a threshold value for unfused powder volume.},

Relative density and hardness are measured through the depth of the manufactured cubes. The study of porosity and hardness through the depth of LPBF-MS1 cubes proves homogeneous properties in the core of the material in comparison with more heterogeneous properties closer to the subsurface layers. X-ray diffraction techniques both on the powder and the as-built samples are then performed to identify phases in the fabricated samples. A correlation between lower austenite content and higher strength is observed for the tensile samples manufactured with lower powder layer thickness. Texture analysis shows a directional grain growth along the building direction resulting in a weak texture, while the material induces a stronger texture with an increased amount of austenite after the deformation. Studying the effects of powder layer thickness shows slightly lower strength and ductility for the samples manufactured with higher powder layer thickness, while the energy consumption, as well as the manufacturing time, are reduced.},

  abstract = {Deep neural networks are powerful tools for approximating functions, and they are applied to successfully solve various problems in many fields. In this paper, we propose a neural network-based numerical method to solve partial differential equations. In this new framework, the method is designed on weak formulations, and the unknown functions are approximated by deep neural networks and test functions can be chosen by different approaches, for instance, basis functions of finite element methods, neural networks, and so on. Because the spaces of trial function and test function are different, we name this new approach by Deep Petrov-Galerkin Method (DPGM). The resulted linear system is not necessarily to be symmetric and square, so the discretized problem is solved by a least-square method. Take the Poisson problem as an example, mixed DPGMs based on several mixed formulations are proposed and studied as well. In addition, we apply the DPGM to solve two classical time-dependent problems based on the space-time approach, that is, the unknown function is approximated by a neural network, in which temporal variable and spatial variables are treated equally, and the initial conditions are regarded as boundary conditions for the space-time domain. Finally, several numerical examples are presented to show the performance of the DPGMs, and we observe that this new method outperforms traditional numerical methods in several aspects.},

To tackle this challenge, efficient and effective methods for feature extraction are critical to the performance of classification analysis. The objective of this work is to develop a new supervised feature extraction method for high-dimensional data. It is achieved by developing a clustered discriminant regression (CDR) to extract informative and discriminant features for high-dimensional data. In CDR, the variables are clustered into different groups or subspaces, within which feature extraction is performed separately. The CDR algorithm, which is a greedy approach, is implemented to obtain the solution toward optimal feature extraction. One numerical study is performed to demonstrate the performance of the proposed method for variable selection. Three case studies using healthcare and additive manufacturing data sets are accomplished to demonstrate the classification performance of the proposed methods for real-world applications. The results clearly show that the proposed method is superior over the existing method for high-dimensional data feature extraction.},

The objective of this work is to develop an algorithm for multi-task Bayesian optimization with automatic task selection so that only one task evaluation is needed per query round. Specifically, a new algorithm, namely, multi-task Gaussian process upper confidence bound (MT-GPUCB), is proposed to achieve this objective. The MT-GPUCB is a two-step algorithm, where the first step chooses which query point to evaluate, and the second step automatically selects the most informative task to evaluate. Under the bandit setting, a theoretical analysis is provided to show that our proposed MT-GPUCB is no-regret under some mild conditions. Our proposed algorithm is verified experimentally on a range of synthetic functions. In addition, our algorithm is applied to Additive Manufacturing simulation software, namely, Flow-3D Weld, to determine material property values, ensuring the quality of simulation output. The results clearly show the advantages of our query strategy for both design point and task.},

For example, one system has high spatial but low temporal resolutions while the other one has opposite resolutions. The goal of this paper is to develop a new super resolution method that integrates these different types of image stream data to improve both spatial and temporal resolutions, which is critical to obtaining more insightful information for more effective quality control of targeted processes or systems.

Hence, additive manufacturing technology has high expectations in industry. Unfortunately, the lack of a proper quality monitoring prohibits the penetration of this technology into an extensive practice. This work investigates the feasibility of using acoustic emission for quality monitoring and combines a sensitive acoustic emission sensor with machine learning. The acoustic signals were recorded using a fiber Bragg grating sensor during the powder bed additive manufacturing process in a commercially available selective laser melting machine. The process parameters were intentionally tuned to invoke different processing regimes that lead to the formation of different types and concentrations of pores (1.42\,{$\pm$}\,0.85 \%, 0.3\,{$\pm$}\,0.18 \% and 0.07\,{$\pm$}\,0.02 \%) inside the workpiece. According to this poor, medium and high part qualities were defined. The acoustic signals collected during processing were grouped accordingly and divided into two separate datasets; one for the training and one for the testing. The acoustic features were the relative energies of the narrow frequency bands of the wavelet packet transform, extracted from all the signals. The classifier, based on spectral convolutional neural network, was trained to differentiate the acoustic features of dissimilar quality. The confidence in classifications varies between 83 and 89 \%. In view of the narrow range of porosity, the results can be considered as promising and they showed the feasibility of the quality monitoring using acoustic emission with the sub-layer spatial resolution.},

Initial defects such as pores inherent to the SLM process are regarded as key factors for the mechanical integrity of BMGs. Here the structural defects in the form of pores are controlled in the SLM-processing of large-scale and fully-amorphous Zr-based BMGs. Their effects on the tensile fracture behaviors are revealed by experimental and computational studies. Under uniaxial tension, 3D-printed BMGs fracture in a brittle mode with almost zero macroscopic plasticity. The ultimate tensile strength (UTS) exhibits a rapid linear decrease with increasing porosity, while the Young's modulus is found to be insensitive in the low-porosity ({$<$}2\%) regime but decreases quickly in the high-porosity regime. Finite element (FE) simulations show different deformation mechanisms for pore-free and pore-containing BMGs. The former fractures with abundant homogeneously distributed shear bands initiated from material inherent weak points, while the latter experiences firstly plastic deformation around some pores with shear transformation zones (STZs). These STZs connect with each other as the load increases, forming a small number of highly localized shear bands, which develop into the final fracture surface. The orientation of the fracture surface in 3D-printed BMGs tends to show a larger angle than that of most as-cast Zr-based BMGs under tension (e.g. 50{$\circ$}) and is predominantly affected by pore structures. The experimental and computational results imply that the printing defects play a dominant role in shear band formation and corresponding mechanical properties for 3D-printed BMGs.},

Guided by data and physical laws, PINNs find a neural network that approximates the solution to a system of PDEs. Such a neural network is obtained by minimizing a loss function in which any prior knowledge of PDEs and data are encoded. Despite its remarkable empirical success in one, two or three dimensional problems, there is little theoretical justification for PINNs. As the number of data grows, PINNs generate a sequence of minimizers which correspond to a sequence of neural networks. We want to answer the question: Does the sequence of minimizers converge to the solution to the PDE? We consider two classes of PDEs: linear second-order elliptic and parabolic. By adapting the Schauder approach and the maximum principle, we show that the sequence of minimizers strongly converges to the PDE solution in \$C\^0\$. Furthermore, we show that if each minimizer satisfies the initial/boundary conditions, the convergence mode becomes \$H\^1\$. Computational examples are provided to illustrate our theoretical findings. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first theoretical work that shows the consistency of PINNs.},

Since molten metals have surface tension gradients, the thermo-capillary effect becomes a driving force of melt flow, which will subsequently determine the molten/solidified track as well as the build surface morphology. In this study, a 3D volume of fluid model has been developed to simulate heat transfer and fluid dynamic during single-track laser scanning. A sequential powder addition algorithm is applied to obtain random powder distribution over a thick substrate. Temperature-dependent thermo-physical properties of Ti-6Al-4V are used to define the material, and a volumetric heat source is included as an approximation to laser irradiation. As a result of continuous melting and solidifying, the thermal behavior, the molten metal flow and the free surface formation can be numerically analyzed. In addition, a two-layer simulation has been carried out to study the interlayer bonding. Simulations results are compared with SLM experiments using the single-track morphology acquired by white-light interferometry. The melt pool widths obtained from simulations are in good agreement with the measured single-track widths. On the other hand, it is observed that single tracks formed in SLM have an elevated bead height, which is not realized numerically.},

  abstract = {In-situ alloying within laser powder-bed fusion, specifically Selective Laser Melting (SLM), has been investigated for the formulation of novel alloys from elemental powders to extend the benefits offered by these technologies. Inadequate preparation of the powder feedstock prior to in-situ alloying can yield inhomogeneous microstructures, often deteriorating the mechanical performance of the deposited parts. The present work was designed to assess the use of the `satelliting' method to create powder feedstocks for in-situ laser powder-bed fusion. The research was carried out on Ti-6Al-4V. Ti-6Al-4V feedstocks obtained by mixing or satelliting elemental powders were investigated and compared to a reference pre-alloyed material. The processability of the different feedstocks was assessed by comparing the microstructure of the deposits originating from the different powder blends. Results show that the powder percolation and particle size distribution of the feedstocks translate in deposited microstructures exhibiting different porosity, elemental segregation, and average grain size, revealing the impact of the powder blend characteristics on the laser energy absorbance and solidification of the alloy. This study provides fundamental insights of how to formulate powder feedstock and aims to support future research activities on the design and development of new alloys for use in powder-based additive manufacturing.},

  abstract = {While significant progress has been made in understanding laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF) as well as the fabrication of various materials using this technology, there is still limited adoption in the industry. One of the key obstacles identified is the lack of materials that can truly manufacture functional parts directly with L-PBF. This paper covers the emerging research on in-situ alloying and multi-metal processing. A comprehensive overview of the underlying scientific topics behind them is presented. The current state of research and progress from different perspectives (the materials and L-PBF processing parameters) are reviewed in order to provide a basis for follow-up research that leads to the development of these approaches. Defects, especially those associated with these two material processing routes, are also elucidated by discussing the mechanisms of their formation, including the main influencing factors, and the tendency to occur. Future research trends and potential topics are illustrated. The final part of this paper summarizes findings from this review and outlines the possibility of in-situ alloying and multi-metal processing using L-PBF.},

We propose to solve high-dimensional PDEs by approximating the solution with a deep neural network which is trained to satisfy the differential operator, initial condition, and boundary conditions. Our algorithm is meshfree, which is key since meshes become infeasible in higher dimensions. Instead of forming a mesh, the neural network is trained on batches of randomly sampled time and space points. The algorithm is tested on a class of high-dimensional free boundary PDEs, which we are able to accurately solve in up to \$200\$ dimensions. The algorithm is also tested on a high-dimensional Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman PDE and Burgers' equation. The deep learning algorithm approximates the general solution to the Burgers' equation for a continuum of different boundary conditions and physical conditions (which can be viewed as a high-dimensional space). We call the algorithm a "Deep Galerkin Method (DGM)" since it is similar in spirit to Galerkin methods, with the solution approximated by a neural network instead of a linear combination of basis functions. In addition, we prove a theorem regarding the approximation power of neural networks for a class of quasilinear parabolic PDEs.},

  abstract = {The quality and characteristics of a powder in powder bed fusion processes play a vital role in the quality of additively manufactured components. Its characteristics may influence the process in various ways. This paper presents an investigation highlighting the influence of powder deterioration on the stability of a molten pool in a laser beam powder bed fusion (LB-PBF, selective laser melting) process and its consequences to the physical properties of the alloy, porosity of 3D-printed components and their mechanical properties. The intention in this was to understand powder reuse as a factor playing a role in the formation of porosity in 3D-printed components. Ti6Al4V (15 {$\mu$}m\textendash 45 {$\mu$}m) was used as a base material in the form of a fresh powder and a degraded one (reused 12 times). Alloy degradation is described by possible changes in the shape of particles, particle size distribution, chemical composition, surface tension, density and viscosity of the melt. An approach of 3D printing singular lines was applied in order to study the behavior of a molten pool at varying powder bed depths. Single-track cross-sections (STCSs) were described with shape parameters and compared. Furthermore, the influence of the molten pool stability on the final density and mechanical properties of a material was discussed. Electromagnetic levitation (EML) was used to measure surface tension and the density of the melt using pieces of printed samples. It was found that the powder degradation influences the mechanical properties of a printed material by destabilizing the pool of molten metal during printing operation by facilitating the axial flow on the melt along the melt track axis. Additionally, the observed axial flow was found to facilitate a localized lack of fusion between concurrent layers. It was also found that the surface tension and density of the melt are only impacted marginally or not at all by increased oxygen content, yet a difference in the temperature dependence of the surface tension was observed.},

In order to observe the balling effect and decrease in surface quality, the samples were printed with no supporting structures placed on the downskin. The stability of the melt pool was investigated as a function of both the inclination angle and along the length of the melt pool. Single-track cross-sections were described by shape parameters and were compared and used to calculate the forces acting on the melt pool as the downskin was printed. The single-melt track tests were printed to produce a series of samples with increasing inclination angles with respect to the baseplate. The increasing angles enabled us to physically simulate specific solidification conditions during the sample printing process. As the inclination angle of the unsupported surface increased, the melt-pool altered in terms of its size, geometry, contact angles, and maximum length of stability. The balling phenomenon was observed, quantified, and compared using roughness tests; it was influenced by the melt track stability according to its geometry. The research results show that a higher linear energy input may decrease the roughness of unsupported surfaces with low inclination angles, while a lower linear energy input may be more effective with higher inclination angles.},

There are two primary benefits of this work: (1) the resulting prediction is based on the material composition and (2) the nonlinear behavior caused by the thermodynamic properties of the material during the non-equilibrium solution is accounted for with extremely high resolution. The predicted temperature response and microstructure evolution for additively manufactured stainless steel 316L using standard handbook-obtained thermodynamic properties are compared with the thermodynamic properties calculated using the CALculation of PHAse Diagrams (CALPHAD) approach.

  abstract = {In this work we accomplished the monitoring and prediction of porosity in laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) additive manufacturing process. This objective was realized by extracting physics-informed meltpool signatures from an in-situ dual-wavelength imaging pyrometer, and subsequently, analyzing these signatures via computationally tractable machine learning approaches. Porosity in LPBF occurs despite extensive optimization of processing conditions due to stochastic causes. Hence, it is essential to continually monitor the process with in-situ sensors for detecting and mitigating incipient pore formation. In this work a tall cuboid-shaped part (10~mm~\texttimes ~10~mm~\texttimes ~137~mm, material ATI 718Plus) was built with controlled porosity by varying laser power and scanning speed. This test caused various types of porosity, such as lack-of-fusion and keyhole formation, with varying degrees of severity in the part. The meltpool was continuously monitored using a dual-wavelength imaging pyrometer installed in the machine. Physically intuitive process signatures, such as meltpool length, temperature distribution, and ejecta (spatter) characteristics, were extracted from the meltpool images. Subsequently, relatively simple machine learning models, e.g., K-Nearest Neighbors, were trained to predict both the severity and type of porosity as a function of these physics-informed meltpool signatures. These models resulted in a prediction accuracy exceeding 95\% (statistical F1-score). The same analysis was carried out with a complex, black-box deep learning convolutional neural network which directly used the meltpool images instead of physics-informed features. The convolutional neural network produced a comparable F1-score in the range of 89\textendash 97\%. These results demonstrate that using pragmatic, physics-informed meltpool signatures within a simple machine learning model is as effective for flaw prediction in LPBF as using a complex and computationally demanding black-box deep learning model.},

Here, neural networks (NNs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are trained to detect flaws in layerwise images of a build, using labeled XCT data as a ground truth. Multiple images were recorded after each layer before and after recoating with various lighting conditions. Classifying networks were given a single image or multiple images of various lighting conditions for training and testing. CNNs demonstrated significantly better performance than NNs across all tasks. Furthermore, CNNs demonstrated improved generalizability, i.e., the ability to generalize to more diverse data than either the training or validation data sets. Specifically, CNNs trained on high-resolution layerwise images from one build showed minimal loss in performance when applied to data from an independent build, whereas the performance of the NNs degraded significantly. CNN accuracy was also demonstrated to be a function of flaw size, suggesting that smaller flaws may be produced by mechanisms that do not alter the surface morphology of the build plate. CNNs demonstrated accuracies of 93.5 \% on large ({$>$}200 {$\mu$}m) flaws when testing and training on components from the same build and accuracies of 87.3 \% when testing on a previously unseen build. Finally, evidence linking the formation of large lack-of-fusion defects to the presence of process ejecta is presented.},

This ability is unique to AM and enables the design of architected materials that were previously unattainable. Here, we leverage this strategy to encode data into metal parts using the microstructure as the medium to store information. We use a novel laser scanning technique to control the local solidification conditions during laser powder bed fusion and embed a linear barcode and Quick Response (QR) code into stainless steel 316L. The codes use blocks of different crystallographic texture\textemdash i.e., regions in which the crystal lattice of most grains is aligned towards a preferred orientation\textemdash as the data ``bits''. The data may be retrieved by analytical techniques that are sensitive to local microstructure variations. As a demonstration, we decode the barcodes by measuring the scattering of optical light from their etched surface using a technique called directional reflectance microscopy. The resulting texture maps are readable by conventional barcode scanners, such as those found on mobile phones. The ability to embed data has significant potential in fields such as law enforcement, biomedicine, and transportation, where permanent, damage-resistant tracking are essential.},

  abstract = {Laser-powder bed fusion (L-PBF) has gained significant research interest, not only for its profound advantage of producing near-net shape complex geometries of metallic parts, but also for the possibility of producing tailored microstructures. Here we exploit the capability of manipulating the crystallographic texture by L-PBF to tailor the deformation behavior of austenitic stainless steels. In specific, by adjusting the laser power and the laser scanning speed, tailored crystallographic textures can be obtained, along the uniaxial loading direction in 304L stainless steel samples produced by L-PBF. In situ neutron diffraction and uniaxial tension and compression tests are undertaken to investigate the extent of the transformation induced plasticity effect and to correlate it with the tailored macrostructures. The influence of the initial and the evolving crystallographic texture on the deformation behavior is demonstrated and elaborated accordingly. The observed asymmetry in the deformation behavior between tension and compression is also discussed in detail.},

  abstract = {For the first time, a high-density amorphous and crack-free bulk metallic glass (BMG) based on a precious metal (PdCuNiP) was produced via additive manufacturing (AM). Laser powder-bed fusion (LPBF) was used for the fabrication of the samples, and led to a density of 99.6\%. Excellent mechanical properties such as high hardness and compressive strength were achieved, overcoming the limitations usually found for precious metals in jewelry and watchmaking. Furthermore, without any post-processing, a mirror-like smooth and brilliant surface was directly obtained, which is highly beneficial for applications where surface finish or aesthetics matters. The effect of the main processing parameters, such as laser power and laser-scanning speed, on the shape of single tracks was investigated by laser confocal microscopy (LCM). Following the single-track experiments, highly amorphous LPBF samples were produced. The samples were characterized by optical microscopy (OM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), conventional and synchrotron X-ray diffraction (XRD), micro-computed tomography ({$\mu$}-CT), compression tests, and microhardness. The crystallization kinetics of the powder alloy was investigated via fast differential scanning calorimetry (FDSC). A small quantity of the powder ({$<$} 70~g) was used for the fabrication of samples, alleviating the cost of the process. Efficient production of precious metal parts with enhanced mechanical properties is demonstrated.},

Because BMGs require sufficiently high cooling rates to bypass crystallization, laser-based additive manufacturing (AM) methods have recently been employed for the fabrication of BMGs. In this study, we present an optimized Laser Powder-Bed Fusion (LPBF) process on a Zr-based BMG (Zr59.3Cu28.8Al10.4Nb1.5, in at.\%), with a focus on characterization, mechanical properties, and dimensional accuracy. A volumetric density of 99.82\% was achieved. Although the sample was qualified as amorphous via laboratory X-ray diffraction experiments, a more meticulous study using synchrotron radiation revealed nanocrystals in the heat-affected zones (HAZs) of the melt pool. Fast differential scanning calorimetry (FDSC) and numerical simulations were then employed to illustrate the mechanism of crystallization. The LPBF-processed alloy revealed excellent mechanical properties, such as high hardness, wear resistance, compressive strength, and flexural strength. Apart from vein-like patterns, the fracture surfaces of the compression test samples showed liquid-like features, which indicate a significant local temperature increase during fracture. The dimensional accuracy was assessed with a benchmark exhibiting complex geometrical features and reached at least 40\,{$\mu$}m. The results indicate that LPBF processing is a promising route for the manufacturing of BMGs for various applications.},

Here, an industrial-grade Zr-based MG (AMZ4) is investigated via fast differential scanning calorimetry (FDSC). The critical cooling and heating rates of AMZ4 are experimentally measured and TTT diagrams are determined upon heating and cooling. The critical heating rate of 45,000 K/s is 18 times the critical cooling rate, which indicates the presence of a self-doped glass (SDG) that includes quenched-in nuclei. The results illustrate that AMZ4 is very sensitive to crystallization, even in laser-based AM conditions, where heating and cooling steps need to be distinguished.},

In the current work, we investigate the fatigue life of a bulk metallic (BMG) glass fabricated via additive manufacturing. Specimens fabricated via laser powder-bed fusion (LPBF) are shown to have a fatigue ratio of 0.20 (fatigue limit of 175 MPa) in a three-point bending fatigue test. Three strategies for improving the fatigue behavior were tested, namely (1) relaxation heat treatment, giving a slight fatigue life improvement at high loading conditions ({$\geq$}250 MPa), (2) laser shock peening, and (3) changing the build orientation, the latter two of which yielded no significant effects. It was found that the presence of lack of fusion (LoF) had the preponderant effect on fatigue resistance of the specimens manufactured. LoF was observed to be a source of stress localization and initiation of cracks. The fatigue life in BMGs fabricated by LPBF is thus primarily influenced by powder quality and process-induced defects, which cannot be removed by the post-treatments carried out in this study. It is believed that a slight increase in laser power, either in the near-surface regions or in the core of the specimens, could improve the fatigue behavior despite the associated (detrimental) increase of crystallized fraction.},

The influence of the laser energy density on the densification, surface morphology, microstructure and mechanical properties of the LPBF-printed 50W\textendash 35Ni\textendash 15Fe alloy was investigated. An increase in the laser energy density (148\textendash 250\,J/mm3) can result in an improvement in the relative density, and the highest relative density of 99.3\% can be obtained at 250\,J/mm3. The microstructure of the 50W\textendash 35Ni\textendash 15Fe alloy consists of a {$\gamma$}(W, Ni, Fe) matrix and W particles dispersed in the matrix. During the LPBF process, the W powder undergoes the process of melting and dissolution in melt pools. The coalescence of melted/dissolved W powder leads to the large-sized W particles, while the nanosized W particles are precipitated in the matrix. Cellular grains of {$\gamma$} are formed around the retained W particles and grow along the thermal gradient to form columnar grains. The 50W\textendash 35Ni\textendash 15Fe alloy printed under the laser energy density of 250\,J/mm3 exhibits the highest ultimate tensile strength of 732.17\,MPa and elongation of 5.64\%. The mechanical strengths were attributed to the synergistic effect of solid solution strengthening and dispersion strengthening. The findings can provide the reference for the development of in situ alloying of W-based alloys by LPBF.},

  abstract = {Although continuous lasers see frequent applications in selective laser melting or sintering, lasers with short pulse durations (such as those with nanosecond scale durations) possess potential advantages that may include good spatial resolutions and small heat-affected zones. Previous work on selective laser sintering with nanosecond lasers has been reported, particularly for laser micro sintering. At a sufficiently high intensity, a nanosecond (ns) laser pulse can generate a plasma plume from its irradiated metallic powder bed surface. The plasma plume evolution, such as the pressure it generates on the surface of the powder bed, may significantly influence the sintering process in the powder bed. However, physics-based modeling work for plasma generated by nanosecond-pulsed laser interaction with a metallic micro powder bed has been seldomly seen in literatures according to the knowledge of the authors'. Such modeling work has been reported in this paper for a \textasciitilde 4-ns laser pulse interaction with a cobalt micro powder bed, integrated with time-resolved plasma imaging using an intensified CCD (ICCD) camera with nanosecond scale gate widths for the model validation. For the conditions investigated, the model-predicted plasma plume evolutions agree reasonably well with the ICCD imaging results for the given period of comparison. This has reasonably supported the hypothesis posed in this paper (which has been rarely tested according to the knowledge of the authors') that a short ns laser pulse-induced plasma from a metallic micro powder bed below the critical temperature can be reasonably well described by solving gas dynamic equations in the gaseous phase together with solving the heat transfer equation in the powder bed condensed phase, where the coupling is via the Knudsen layer (KL) relations for vaporization at the interface between the two phases. The model calculations show that in comparison with the bulk cobalt situation, the ns laser pulse can induce more significant surface vaporization from the cobalt powder bed, leading to a plasma plume with typically higher peak temperatures and densities in the simulated period. The plume can generate a short total pressure pulse with a \textasciitilde 491-MPa peak magnitude on the surface of the powder bed.},

In order for this technology to see more widespread use as a production modality, especially in heavily regulated industries such as aerospace and medical device manufacturing, there is a need for robust process monitoring and control capabilities to be developed that reduce process variation and ensure quality. The current state of the art of such process monitoring technology is reviewed in this paper. The SLM process itself presents significant challenges as over 50 different process input variables impact the characteristics of the finished part. Understanding the impact of feed powder characteristics remains a challenge. Though many powder characterization techniques have been developed, there is a need for standardization of methods most relevant to additive manufacturing. In-process sensing technologies have primarily focused on monitoring melt pool signatures, either from a Lagrangian reference frame that follows the focal point of the laser or from a fixed Eulerian reference frame. Correlations between process measurements, process parameter settings, and quality metrics to date have been primarily qualitative. Some simple, first-generation process control strategies have also been demonstrated based on these measures. There remains a need for connecting process measurements to process models to enable robust model-based control.},

The most frequently used process modelling approaches were reviewed and summarized with respect to the process modelling approach, scale and limitations. The different categories of process modelling approaches were compared, with molecular dynamics being a promising modelling technique that can be used in software applications. A new framework for modelling additive manufacturing processes based on molecular dynamics was proposed in this work, combining previously published manufacturing methodologies for the AM process, such as manufacturability, design and planning of the AM. A validation plan followed, with the main parameters and details highlighted. The proposed framework is offering a unique approach for modelling the AM process, based on parameters from the manufacturing design, planning and process.

  abstract = {The origin of interfacial turbulence, spontaneous agitation of the interface between two unequilibrated liquids, has been explained in terms of classical flow, diffusion, and surface processes. The essence of the explanation is the long-known though much neglected Marangoni effect, wherein movement in an interface is caused by longitudinal variations of interfacial tension. It is proposed that interfacial turbulence is a manifestation of hydrodynamic instability, which is touched off by ever present, small, random fluctuations about the interface. A simplified mathematical model has been analyzed in order to detail the mechanism of the ``interfacial engine'' which supplies the mechanical energy of interfacial turbulence. In its present form the analysis incorporates several drastic simplifications, though ways of removing some of these have been suggested. The groundwork has been laid for the more elaborate analyses that are needed for a decisive test of the theory. The analysis shows how some systems may be stable with solute transfer in one direction yet unstable with transfer in the opposite direction, a striking result. It also suggests that interfacial turbulence is usually promoted by (1) solute transfer out of the phase of higher viscosity, (2) solute transfer out of the phase in which its diffusivity is lower, (3) large differences in kinematic viscosity and solute diffusivity between the two phases, (4) steep concentration gradients near the interface, (5) interfacial tension highly sensitive to solute concentration, (6) low viscosities and diffusivities in both phases, (7) absence of surface-active agents, and (8) interfaces of large extent. That some of these effects have been observed in the laboratory lends credence to the theory.},

Deep neural networks rely on adaptive algorithms to master a wide variety of tasks, including cancer diagnosis, object recognition, speech recognition, robotic control, chess, poker, backgammon and Go, at super-human levels of performance.  In this richly illustrated book, key neural network learning algorithms are explained informally first, followed by detailed mathematical analyses. Topics include both historically important neural networks (perceptrons, Hopfield nets, Boltzmann machines and backpropagation networks), and modern deep neural networks (variational autoencoders, convolutional networks, generative adversarial networks, and reinforcement learning using SARSA and Q-learning). Online computer programs, collated from open source repositories, give hands-on experience of neural networks, and PowerPoint slides provide support for teaching. Written in an informal style, with a comprehensive glossary, tutorial appendices (e.g. Bayes' theorem, maximum likelihood estimation), and a list of further readings, this is an ideal introduction to the algorithmic engines of modern artificial intelligence.},

  abstract = {In this review, the phenomenon of grain boundary (GB) wetting by the second solid phase is analyzed for the high entropy alloys (HEAs). Similar to the GB wetting by the liquid phase, the GB wetting by the second solid phase can be incomplete (partial) or complete. In the former case, the second solid phase forms in the GB of a matrix, the chain of (usually lenticular) precipitates with a certain non-zero contact angle. In the latter case, it forms in the GB continuous layers between matrix grains which completely separate the matrix crystallites. The GB wetting by the second solid phase can be observed in HEAs produced by all solidification-based technologies. The particle chains or continuous layers of a second solid phase form in GBs also without the mediation of a liquid phase, for example by solid-phase sintering or coatings deposition. To describe the GB wetting by the second solid phase, the new GB tie-lines should be considered in the two- or multiphase areas in the multicomponent phase diagrams for HEAs. The GB wetting by the second solid phase can be used to improve the properties of HEAs by applying the so-called grain boundary engineering methods.},

The meshfree method in this present work uses a Lagrangian reference frame, which permits tracking of material point history. A solid mechanics formulation is used, allowing the resolution of both elastic and plastic strains. An explicit dynamics time stepping scheme is used to ensure that the code is robust for the large level of non-linearity native to the AFS-D process. In this present work, a description of the meshfree method will first be described. Then a new thermo-mechanical joining contact algorithm will be introduced. Following that, a description of the experimental setup for the AFS-D model calibration experimental one layer deposition cases is explained. Subsequently, the simulation model and results for three different parameter sets will be detailed and compared against the experimental results. Finally, temperature and strain rate gradients are revealed across the entire deposition elucidating spatial-temporal flow phenomena in the AFS-D process.},

Therefore, being able to accurately and quickly simulate the size, shape, and solidification characteristics in the melt pool is of great interest to the field. This study investigates various important physical phenomena (dynamic material properties, fluid-flow, radiation and vaporization) which can either be included or neglected in a continuum finite volume model (FVM) and their effect on the solidification conditions. Additionally, since the simplest form of such a model (conduction only) has an analytic solution which is much faster, its viability is also considered. Since the inclusion of some of these physical phenomena will inherently change the net energy input as well as the amount of energy needed to achieve melting of a control volume, each set of included phenomena had an effective absorption efficiency which was calibrated to closely match the dimensions of the melt pool to that of the ground truth data. The ground truth data for this study was defined to be the output of the FVM which included all the physical phenomena (OF). This study then goes on to compare the effects on solidification conditions each of these calibrated models has. It was found that most of the change in solidification conditions comes from the inclusion of latent heat. A posterior correlation factor is then introduced to enable an analytic model to predict similar solidification conditions to OF model.},

The current work examines how microstructures and phases change for additively manufactured 17-4PH thin walls as a function of laser path length, path direction, and wall thickness. Two sample sets were designed, each consisting of four walls with thicknesses of 6.4\,mm to 0.8\,mm. In the first set, the wall axes were parallel to the scan axes, such that the laser path length varied from layer to layer with the laser path either being parallel or perpendicular to the wall. In the second set, the walls lay at 45\textdegree{} to the scan axes, such that the laser path had the same length in all layers and gradually decreased with wall thickness. Substantial changes in phase stability and microstructure are observed as the wall thickness decreases, with ferritic phases and coarse grains changing to fine grains and an increasing volume fraction of austenite. These changes are attributed to changes in the local temperature-time profile as the length of the laser paths change from 19\,mm to 0.8\,mm. These observations demonstrate the range of microstructure and phase control options available in additive manufacturing with judicious selections of part layouts on build plates and of laser beam directions.},

To understand and control the grain evolution, a multiscale simulation is applied to investigate the relationship between the grain selection, growth orientation, and the molten pool morphology with the different deposition layer numbers and processing parameters. The accuracy of the simulation is validated by experiments in both qualitative and quantitative ways. Results show that when the grain with unfavorable orientation loses the competitive growth with its neighbors, there will be a great chance that the blocked grain is eliminated in the following layer-and-layer deposition, which leads to the increase of the grain width. The size of the molten pool increases remarkably as the layer number increases, which lays a heavy burden on the stability of the molten pool. The analytical relationship between the molten pool morphology and the grain growth orientation is also deduced. The flat molten pool causes the grains with the {$<$}001{$>$} direction close to the building direction to have greater survival potential. Besides, decreasing the line power energy shows little effect on the stability of the molten pool and the grain growth orientation, especially when the deposited layer number is large. The revealing mechanisms will help in understanding and further controlling the grain evolution.},

Unlike the conventional wrought Al\textendash Si eutectic alloys available for AM process, the strength of new developed Al alloy can be improved by in situ or additional nano-precipitated phase. This paper presents an overview of high strength Al alloys development including metallic additives, such as Zr, Sc, Mn, Cu, etc., and nanoparticle additives, such as ceramics (TiB2, TiC, LaB6 and TiN) as well as carbon nanotubes (CNTs). The addition of Zr and Sc elements significantly prevents hot tearing and enhances the strength of laser processed Al alloys because the nanoscale Al3Zr, Al3Sc and Al3 (Sc, Zr) precipitated phases generate, facilitate the heterogeneous nucleation of Al matrix and refine the microstructure. Moreover, the addition of Mn and Cu elements provides an increment in the toughness and strength of laser processed Al alloys through the superimposed effect of multi-element solid solution reinforcement and precipitation strengthening role of some Al2CuMg and Al6Mn. The growth process of Al alloy can be interrupted by the addition of nanoceramics particles as additional nucleation site which leads the columnar grain transforms to the equiaxed grain. Furthermore, the mechanism of mutual solubility of LaB6, TiB2, TiC and TiN in Al alloys is systematically studied. Finally, an assessment of the state in laser processed high strength Al alloys and the research demands for the expansion of laser powder bed fusion of Al metallic components are provided.},

Experiencing dissimilar materials interactions, the physical phenomena in the MMLPBF process are more complex. In this study, a computation fluid dynamic model in the mesoscale for simulating single-track MMLPBF melt pool behavior is developed. The characteristics of melting IN718/Cu10Sn powder beds were investigated. It is shown that in melting a mixed IN718/Cu10Sn powder bed, the temperature of the melt pool decreases with increasing Cu10Sn fraction, owing to the difference in the thermal\textendash physical properties of dissimilar metals, particularly the melting points, laser beam absorptivity and thermal conductivity. A braze zone is formed on the edge of a solidified track on the powder bed with mixed dissimilar powders having melted Cu10Sn and un-melted or partially melted In718, which results in fluctuations in the track dimensions. For unmixed dissimilar powder beds, an asymmetrical melt pool and solidified track are formed if the laser spot overlaps the interface of the dissimilar powders. The effect of hatch spacing in multiple track melting on a mixed dissimilar powder bed is also studied. It indicates that owing to the significant fluctuation in the track dimensions, the hatch spacing should be adjusted adaptively and should be less than the width of the melted zone to avoid insufficient intertrack fusion.},

  abstract = {This work describes a Dynamic Kinetic Monte Carlo numerical modeling framework that can predict the microstructure of metals during powder bed fusion (PBF) and directed energy deposition (DED) additive manufacturing (AM) while considering significant variations in thermal history and heat accumulation that occur during the build. Although the conventional Kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) method is well-established, it does not accommodate variation in the spatial domains of the melt pool (MP) and heat affected zone (HAZ) with time. Thus, the predicted microstructure remains relatively similar even over large AM build domains. While the existing KMC approach may suffice over spatial regions in which the MP and HAZ remain relatively unchanged, this circumstance is largely contrary to what experimentalists have recently found when imaging different regions in PBF and DED AM builds, thus raising issues with scalability and versatility of the method. The Dynamic KMC framework proposed in this work addresses these concerns by implementing discretized, spatially-varying MP and HAZ at every time increment during the grain structure prediction. The new framework operates in two stages; stage one establishes the 3D spatial MP and HAZ dimensions using either thermal finite element (FE) simulation or through experimental 3D thermal imaging; stage two subsequently integrates these time-varying MP and HAZ dimensions into the KMC algorithm at every time increment during the build. Thus, the Dynamic KMC framework captures the effects that rapid thermal cycles and heat accumulation have on grain nucleation and growth. The method is demonstrated through a case study involving a thin-walled Inconel 625 structure made by the selective laser melting (SLM) type of laser-based powder bed fusion (PBF-LB). The numerically predicted microstructures at various regions and scan layers within the build show strong agreement with experimentally observed trends reported in literature. Significant variations in grain morphology predicted by the Dynamic KMC framework can, according to specific thermal histories, provide investigators with new capabilities in assessing mechanical property variations across different regions of AM parts.},

  abstract = {One major hindrance that alloy design for additive manufacturing (AM) faces nowadays is hot tearing. Contrary to the previous works which either try to reduce solidification range or introduce grain refinement, the current work presents a new approach of employing segregation engineering to alter the residual stress states at the interdendritic and grain boundary regions and consequently prevent hot tearing. Here, in situ Al alloying is introduced into an existing hot-cracking susceptible high-entropy alloy CoCrFeNi. It is found that within a certain range of compositions, such as Al0.5CoCrFeNi, the hot crack density was drastically decreased. During the solidification of this specific alloy composition, Al is firstly ejected from the primary dendritic face-centred cubic (FCC) phase and segregates into the interdendritic regions. Spinodal decomposition then occurs in these Al-enriched regions to form the ordered B2 NiAl and disordered body-centred cubic (BCC) Cr phases. Due to the higher molar volume and lower homologous temperatures of these B2/BCC phases, the inherent residual strain is accommodated and transformed from a maximum 0.006 tensile strain in CoCrFeNi to a compressive strain of {$\sim$}0.001 in Al0.5CoCrFeNi. It is believed that this grain boundary segregation engineering method could provide a new pathway to systematically counteract the hot tearing problem in additive manufacturing of metals and alloys, using available thermodynamic and kinetic database information.},

Single-layer and five-layer WLAM experiments are conducted to validate the accuracy of the simulation. The simulation results agree with the experimental results.

The differences between the processes are linked to changes in chemistry in the microstructure: carbon pickup from MIM binder and slow cooling rate is responsible for the appearance of Ti2C resulting in low ductility and very high strength together with a transition from intergranular to transgranular fracture.},

  abstract = {A model for simulating layer-by-layer melting and solidification of a binary alloy powder bed due to a moving laser source is presented in this paper. The model uses a modified enthalpy-porosity approach to capture simultaneous melting and solidification of a powder bed. The effects of surface tension driven Marangoni convection and thermal and solutal buoyancy driven convection are incorporated in the model. Multiple layer formation is modeled by shifting the domain in the vertical direction to include the new layer. Simulations are performed for Al-Cu alloy to see the effect of different process parameters on the melt pool evolution, solute transport and segregation, and thermal transport with the primary focus on quantifying the nonhomogeneity in the final species distribution. Fixed melt pool results show that the effect of Marangoni convection is dominant resulting in considerably increased segregation in the solidified region. Simulation of layer-by-layer melting and solidification of the entire domain show that the solidified region can be divided into three zones based on solute distribution\textemdash initial low concentration zone, middle zone with slightly higher concentration, and the final zone with very high concentration. Subsequently, parametric studies are done that show that the nonuniformity in solute distribution can be reduced by reducing the laser power, increasing the laser spot radius, increasing the initial solute concentration, or decreasing the layer thickness.},

Fracture on the continuum level is modeled by the extended finite element method (XFEM). Using several novel or state of the art methods, the piece software handles semi-concurrent multiscale methods as well as concurrent multiscale methods for fracture, coupling two continuum domains or atomistic domains to continuum domains, respectively.

Compared to conventional manufacturing technologies, an additional advantage of l-PBF process is the capability to fabricate parts with multiple materials, such as in-situ alloying and functionally graded alloys. In this regard, here we present a computational model to simulate the l-PBF of multiple materials. Based on volume of fluid (VOF) methods and computational fluid dynamics (CFD), the multi-physics multi-material model was successfully implemented with various physics of l-PBF process, including surface tension, Marangoni shear force, recoil pressure, compositional diffusion, etc. In addition, we demonstrated the numerical algorithm of ray tracing heat source for multiple materials. With reasonable assumptions, conduction mode or keyhole mode laser melting of miscible materials can be simulated via the proposed computational framework. Furthermore, such multi-physics model is capable of simulating l-PBF of an arbitrary number of materials. The computational model can help achieve insightful understanding of the l-PBF of multiple materials.},

The constitutive relation of individual grains in the micro-scale reconstructed models is described with the single-crystal-scale plasticity model. Meanwhile, to reduce the computational cost, a polycrystal-scale plasticity model is also established. The homogeneous elastic moduli tensor is computed according to Mori-Tanaka's theory, while the plastic deformation is described by the equivalent grain set. The proposed multi-scale modelling framework is validated against experiments, where the as-built Ti-6Al-4V samples fabricated by selective laser melting (SLM) are tested under uniaxial tensile, compressive, and cyclic loadings. The presented experimental and computational study demonstrates the capability of the proposed multi-scale modelling framework in the structure-property analysis of AMed metals.},

Use of a 290\textendash 1100~nm waveband high-speed camera allowed capturing images with more complete spatter signatures and a more complex background compared with previous LPBF studies. Conventional image segmentation approaches are inadequate to perform spatter extraction because of the complex background. The proposed NN-based image segmentation method split images into a block grid and segmented each block using a parallel convolutional neural network (CNN) and a thresholding neural network (TNN), which permitted extracting 80.48\% of spatters in only 70~ms. Furthermore, the ability to extract spatters connected to a molten pool distinguishes the proposed NN-based image segmentation method from conventional image segmentation approaches.},

This is particularly true in industrial sectors with stringent requirements on part quality such as the aerospace and healthcare sectors. One approach to overcome this challenge that has recently been receiving increasing attention is process monitoring and real-time process control to enhance part quality and repeatability. This has been addressed by numerous research efforts in the past decade and continues to be identified as a high priority research goal. In this review paper, we fill an important gap in the literature represented by the absence of one single source that comprehensively describes what has been achieved and provides insight on what still needs to be achieved in the field ofprocess monitoring and control for metal-based AM processes.},

  abstract = {Test artifacts have been used to evaluate additive manufacturing (AM) systems since the early 1990s with over 65 artifacts published to date. Due to the system agnostic approach to artifact design, principally focused on geometric accuracy, there has yet to be a widely adopted artifact for laser powder bed fusion (LPBF). To speed qualification of LPBF, a rapid method that quantifies impacts of process variables on part structure, properties, and performance is required. Using a list of design requirements developed from literature, build experience, and needs from several major roadmapping efforts, a test artifact was designed to evaluate geometry-specific microstructure, dimensional accuracy, residual stress, chemistry, surface integrity, powder removal, and distortion. The LPBF artifact includes: four sides for geometric feature accuracy and surface integrity analysis, indication marks for accurate sectioning for metallography, and additional features specifically designed to evaluate residual stress, powder removal, mechanical properties and distortion. The artifact is compact and designed to fit within a standard 50mm metallographic mount with indication marks used to improve measurement repeatability and accuracy. Microstructure and anomaly population are quantifiable on features including overhangs, islands, thin features, channels, lattice structures and bulk areas representing different thermal histories. It is believed that this single test artifact can be used for many purposes, including optimization of LPBF input variables, qualification and more. Ongoing work is continuing to improve the artifact design, testing its implementation across LPBF platforms, and using the artifact to concretely define process sensitivity currently limiting standardization and adoption of LPBF due to costs associated with defining process windows in terms of qualification and certification. As part of this effort, the artifact described here forms the basis of the Global Test Artifact Data Exchange Program \textendash{} a program designed and managed by the authors for the benefit of research to advance LPBF qualification efforts and help lead to more widespread adoption of LPBF (described in more detail at keck.utep.edu/GTADExP).},

  abstract = {This study proposes an implementation of the cellular automata finite element (CAFE) model in order to optimize its performance for simulating the solidification of additively manufactured (AM) materials. The translating melt pool in AM leads to a highly localized region of activity at any given time. The time scale associated with the evolving temperature field is much larger than the time scale associated with grain solidification. A separation of temporal scales is proposed such that solidification analysis is treated independently as sub-cycles within each discrete time step of the scanning laser. At each laser time step, all of the domain is idle except a small portion, which is the region where the material is undercooled but has yet to be solidified. This region is identified, and a second partition of the computational resources is established such that the solidification computations are evenly balanced. Numerical studies demonstrate that the proposed implementation achieves dramatic improvement in parallel scalability than previously reported and thus advances the state-of-the-art of CAFE modeling for AM in terms of computational efficiency. This improved computational performance is necessary to simulate the large 3D polycrystalline microstructures required to evaluate texture and grain morphology, and two of such simulations are presented. The model is validated for laser powder bed fusion 316L stainless steel, where the polycrystalline grain morphology and crystallographic texture of the simulated microstructure closely match experimental characterization data. A second simulation is performed for a different scan pattern in order to highlight and evaluate its effect on microstructural features.},

Post-build radiography was used to identify the locations of keyhole pores in the build. The pore locations were spatially and temporally registered with the recorded time-series of laser position and acoustic pressure to identify specific partitions of the acoustic signals which correspond to pore formation. Ensemble empirical mode decomposition, traditional Fourier decomposition, and statistical measures of the time-series and corresponding frequency spectra were used to extract feature vectors which correlate to keyhole pore formation. Sequential feature selection revealed that measures associated with the acoustic spectra were most useful for identifying pore formations in L-PBF. A subset of the most informative data features was used to train a support vector machine model to predict pore formation with up to 97\% accuracy.},

In this paper, a method to scale-up the process parameters from low to high layer thickness is proposed. The method is based on dimensionless parameters from the analytical model. Through the proposed scale-up method, the build rate increase was proportional to an increase in layer thickness. The scale-up method was demonstrated for laser powder bed fusion of stainless steel 316L from 30 to 50\,{$\mu$}m layer thickness and from 50 to 70\,{$\mu$}m layer thickness. For both cases, no detriment to part density was observed\textemdash measured densities before and after the scale-up were above 99.6\%. The density results obtained were within high density windows with variation of parameters resulting in the same respective volumetric energy densities and one-factor-at-a-time parameter studies. There was no significant change in tensile properties after the scale-up except reduction in elongation at break in the XY direction. The comparable mechanical properties before and after the scale-up method were attributed to the observed similarities in microstructure features such as the crystal orientation, cell sizes, and proportions of low and high angle grain boundaries.},

Estimation of fault probability was carried out experimentally in a Renishaw AM250 machine, by collecting Fe3Si powder bed height data, in-situ, during the metal additive manufacturing of a Heat Exchanger section, comprised of a series of conformal channels. Specifically, high-resolution powder bed surface height data from a laser profilometer was linked to post-print ground-truth labels (faulty or nominal) for each site from CT scans, by training a shallow artificial neural net (ANN). The ANN demonstrated interesting capabilities for discovering correlations between surface roughness characteristics and the presence and size of faults. Strong performance was achieved with respect to several standard metrics for classifying faulty and nominal sites. These developments can potentially enable active monitoring processes to become a future component of a layer-by-layer feedback system for better control of SLM processes.},

  abstract = {Use of laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) additive manufacturing (AM) in structural applications requires development of a) damage-tolerant alloys (alloys that exhibit high strength and ductility despite the presence of pores and/or microcracks), and b) corrosion resistant alloys. High entropy alloys (HEAs) offer abundant alloy design space that can be used to tune deformation mechanisms and address both these challenges effectively. In line with that, transformation induced plasticity (TRIP) assisted Fe38.5Mn20Co20Cr15Si5Cu1.5 HEA (Cu-HEA) was printed with LPBF-AM. Despite the presence of 1.5 vol. \% of microcracks and pores, as-built Cu-HEA exhibits tensile strength of {$\sim$}1235 MPa (highest among as-built HEAs) and ductility of {$\sim$}17.2 \%, thus displaying damage-tolerant behavior. Additionally, as-built Cu-HEA exhibits a steeper polarization slope as compared to SS 17-4 PH and as-cast Cu-HEA, thus exhibiting higher passivation tendency. These findings demonstrate an effective strategy for developing damage-tolerant anticorrosive materials for LPBF-AM.},

  abstract = {Laser-powder bed fusion (L-PBF) additive manufacturing offers unprecedented microstructural fine-tuning capabilities. Naturally, benefitting from such capability requires alloys that are amenable to microstructural heterogeneity and hierarchy (MHH) and that exhibit a low hot-cracking susceptibility (HCS). However, columnar growth, which is characterized by capillary effects and poor strain accommodation capabilities, is prevalent in L-PBF and increases the HCS of the processed alloys. Further, while solute segregation is prominent in cellular and dendritic growth modes during L-PBF, the effects of solute segregation on the alloy HCS and L-PBF-processing window remain widely unexplored. Here, we demonstrate that solute segregation affects columnar growth, grain coalescence behavior during solidification, MHH and mechanical properties of a metastable Fe40Mn20Co20Cr15Si5 (at.\%) high entropy alloy (CS-HEA) doped with 0.5 wt.\% B4C (termed CS-BC). A theoretical framework is proposed, which reveals that a boundary-strengthening segregant may reduce the alloy HCS during L-PBF. In as-built CS-BC, boron, a boundary strengthener, segregated to the solidification cell boundaries, whereas carbon remained in the solid solution. The as-built CS-BC exhibited suppressed columnar growth, more random texture, smaller cell size and higher strength as compared to the as-built CS-HEA. Further, a wide crack-free L-PBF processing window of CS-BC allowed fine-tuning of its MHH and thus the mechanical properties. Upon annealing, as carbon-containing precipitates formed, CS-BC exhibited a metastable microstructure and transformation induced plasticity effect, which led to high synergistic strength-ductility. Findings will foster design of alloys that facilitate application-specific manufacture with L-PBF and thus, an extended outreach of L-PBF for structural applications.},

  abstract = {The M789 steel was designed by voestalpine group based on Grade 250 maraging steel to maintain good printability and increase the corrosion resistance. In this work, the M789 steel was manufactured by laser powder bed fusion process. The microstructural evolution of additively manufactured M789 steel was studied using optical and electron microscopy techniques. In the as-printed condition, the epitaxial grain growth with cellular dendritic structure was detected. The primary dendrite arm spacing was measured to be 0.42\,{$\pm$}\,0.12\,{$\mu$}m, suggesting the cooling rate is in order of 106 \textdegree C/s during solidification. This high cooling rate eliminates the occurrence of precipitation. The electron backscatter diffraction maps indicate the formation of elongated columnar grains with significant low-angle grain boundaries. After solution annealing and aging treatment, large needle-like martensitic structures were observed with fewer LAGBs than the as-printed condition. Spherical ETA-Ni3(Ti,Al) precipitates ({$\eta$}-phase) were formed during the heat treatment, leading to a significant increase in hardness, tensile strength, and yield strength compared to the as-printed condition. The tensile strength and yield strength along the building direction are 1798\,{$\pm$}\,4 and 1714\,{$\pm$}\,13\,MPa, respectively. However, the elongation and toughness in the heat-treated condition are lower than that of the as-printed condition. Thermodynamic and mechanical properties simulations were also carried out, and the results are consistent with the experimental data.},

The numerical results indicated that melt tracks with different morphologies were formed when the same linear energy density (LED) was applied. The formation mechanism of the melt track defects including balling, porosity and distortion were analyzed. It was found that the balling defect was concluded to be resulted by insufficient energy input incapable of melting the substrate. The distortion defect originated from the combined effect of the random distribution of powder particles and the Marangoni effect. In the keyhole-mode laser melting process, the unsteady behavior of the molten pool and keyhole led to the porosity defect.},

After carefully validating the applicability of the method, the effective absorptivity is plotted as a function of incident laser power from 30 up to {$\approx$}540~W for scanning speeds of 100, 500 and 1500~mm~s-1. The effective absorptivity versus power curves of the bulk materials typically show a slight change in effective absorptivity from 30~W until the onset of the formation of a recoil pressure-induced surface depression. As observed using high-speed video, this change in surface morphology leads to an increase in absorption of the laser light. At the higher powers beyond the keyhole transition, a saturation value is reached for both bare discs and powder-coated disks. For {$\approx$}100~{$\mu$}m thick powder layers, the measured absorptivity was found to be two times that of the bare polished discs for low-laser power. There is a sharp decrease when full melting of the powder tracks is achieved, followed by a keyhole-driven increase at higher powers, similar to the bare disc case. It is shown that, under conditions associated with laser powder-bed fusion additive manufacturing, absorptivity values can vary greatly, and differ from both powder-layer measurements and liquid metal estimates from the literature.},

However, the quality of the built parts obtained via the PBF-LB/M processes varies with the building conditions, and a thorough understanding of the building mechanism has not been achieved owing to the complex and interrelated process parameters involved. The incident angle of the laser beam, which changes on the platform during the laser beam scan owing to the designed three-dimensional data, is among the principal parameters that affects the building aspects. In this study, the melt pool in the singletrack formation during the PBF-LB/M processes was visualised using a high-speed camera, and the influence of the laser incident angle on the ejection characteristics of spatter particles formed around the laser-irradiated area was investigated. Consequently, the spatter particles and metal vapour jet behaviour varied with the laser incident angle. There was a reduction in number of spatter particles owing to the origin of the incident direction being from behind the laser irradiation area. In addition, the laser incident angle also affected the melt pool morphology because of the depression in the melting. Furthermore, the burial depth of the pores varied with the laser incident angle, and is related to the depth of the depression during the melt pool formation.},

Efforts are underway for live process monitoring such as thermal and image-based data gathering for every layer printed. Current crystal plasticity finite element (CPFE) modelling is capable of predicting the associated strength based on a microstructural image and material data but is computationally expensive. This work utilizes a large database of input-output samples from CPFE modelling to develop a trained deep neural network (DNN) model which instantly estimates the output (strength prediction) associated with a given input (microstructure) of multi-phase additive manufactured stainless steels. The DNN model successfully recognizes phase regions and the associated unique crystallographic orientation variations. It also captures differences in macroscopic stress response due to the varying microstructure. However, it is less reliable in terms of fatigue life predictions. The DNN model exhibits high accuracy for the structure-property relationship as a surrogate predicting tool compared to CPFE while significantly reducing the computational cost to a few seconds.},

To ensure that the designed precision is matched by the produced LPBF parts, a full understanding of the interaction between the laser and the feedstock powder is needed. It has been shown that the laser also melts subjacent layers of material underneath. This effect plays a key role when designing small cavities or overhanging structures, because, in these cases, the material underneath is feed-stock powder. In this study, we quantify the extension of the melt pool during laser illumination of powder layers and the defect spatial distribution in a cylindrical specimen. During the LPBF process, several layers were intentionally not exposed to the laser beam at various locations, while the build process was monitored by thermography and optical tomography. The cylinder was finally scanned by X-ray computed tomography (XCT). To correlate the positions of the unmolten layers in the part, a staircase was manufactured around the cylinder for easier registration. The results show that healing among layers occurs if a scan strategy is applied, where the orientation of the hatches is changed for each subsequent layer. They also show that small pores and surface roughness of solidified material below a thick layer of unmolten material (\&gt;200 \textmu m) serve as seeding points for larger voids. The orientation of the first two layers fully exposed after a thick layer of unmolten powder shapes the orientation of these voids, created by a lack of fusion.},

The modification of 316L by the addition of Cr2N significantly improved the corrosion resistance.

  abstract = {Tailoring heat treatments for Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF) processed materials is critical to ensure superior and repeatable material properties for high-end applications. This tailoring requires in-depth understanding of the LPBF-processed material. Therefore, the current study aims at unravelling the threefold interrelationship between the process (LPBF and heat treatment), the microstructure at different scales (macro-, meso-, micro-, and nano-scale), and the macroscopic material properties of AlSi10Mg. A similar solidification trajectory applies at different length scales when comparing the solidification of AlSi10Mg, ranging from mould-casting to rapid solidification (LPBF). The similarity in solidification trajectories triggers the reason why the Brody-Flemings cellular microsegregation solidification model could predict the cellular morphology of the LPBF as-printed microstructure. Where rapid solidification occurs at a much finer scale, the LPBF microstructure exhibits a significant grain refinement and a high degree of silicon (Si) supersaturation. This study has identified the grain refinement and Si supersaturation as critical assets of the as-printed microstructure, playing a vital role in achieving superior mechanical and thermal properties during heat treatment. Next, an electrical conductivity model could accurately predict the Si solute concentration in LPBF-processed and heat-treated AlSi10Mg and allows understanding the microstructural evolution during heat treatment. The LPBF-processed and heat-treated AlSi10Mg conditions (as-built (AB), direct-aged (DA), stress-relieved (SR), preheated (PH)) show an interesting range of superior mechanical properties (tensile strength: 300\textendash 450~MPa, elongation: 4\textendash 13\%) compared to the mould-cast T6 reference condition.},

The differences between frequentism and Bayesianism fundamentally stem from differing definitions of probability, a philosophical divide which leads to distinct approaches to the solution of statistical problems as well as contrasting ways of asking and answering questions about unknown parameters. After an example-driven discussion of these differences, we briefly compare several leading Python statistical packages which implement frequentist inference using classical methods and Bayesian inference using Markov Chain Monte Carlo.},

  abstract = {In laser powder bed fusion (LPBF), it is common practice to select process parameters to achieve high density parts starting from simple geometries such as cubes or cylinders. However, additive manufacturing is usually adopted to produce very complex geometries, where parameters should be tuned locally, depending on the local features to be processed. In fact, geometrical features, such as overhangs, acute corners, and thin walls may lead to over- or under-heating conditions, which may result in geometrical inaccuracy, high roughness, volumetric errors (i.e., porosity) or even job failure due to surface collapse. This work proposes a layer-wise control strategy to improve the geometrical precision of overhanging regions using a coaxial melt pool monitoring system. The melt-pool images acquired at each layer are used in a control-loop to adapt the process parameters locally at the next layer in order to minimize surface defects. In particular, the laser duty cycle is used as a controllable parameter to correct the energy density. This work presents the main architecture of the proposed approach, the control strategy and the experimental procedure that need to be applied to design the control parameters. The layer-wise control strategy was tested on AISI 316L stainless steel using an open LPFB platform. The results showed that the proposed layer-wise control solution results in a constant melt pool observed via the laser heated area size starting from the second layer onward, leading to a significant improvement in the geometrical accuracy of 5 mm-long bridge geometries.},

  abstract = {Process consistency and control are bottleneck issues to wider insertion of powder-bed fusion additive manufacturing in the industrial shopfloor. Of particular interest is the porosity of the components, which remains the limiting factor to high-cycle fatigue performance. Recent experiments have shown that, with increasing energy density, a surge in porosity is seen in selectively laser melted metals. In this high-energy density regime, porosity must originate from mechanisms that are different from the well-known incomplete melting in the low energy density regime. To shed light on this interesting phenomenon, this paper first discusses the mechanism of bubble formation in the melt pool and possible trapping during the solidification, and then formulates a predictive model for porosity in this regime. To compare with experimental results, we perform computer modeling and simulations which have been fully validated by experiments to determine the parameters in the model. We show that the model predictions are in good qualitative and quantitative agreement with the experimental measurements. Hence, the proposed model can be used as a tool to predict the porosity, and further to control and possibly reduce porosity in laser powder-bed fusion additive manufacturing, paving the way for its wider adoption in manufacturing shopfloors.},

Depositions performed at equal energy inputs, but variable laser powers, produced keyhole mode depositions for laser powers {$\geq$} 150W and conduction mode depositions for laser powers below 150W. The laser power combined to the laser exposure time was found to control the penetration depth, increasing from 50{$\mu$}m to 300{$\mu$}m as the laser exposure increases. An increase in laser exposure time was found to decrease the isotherm liquidus velocity, from 1.2mms-1 to 0.2mms-1. EBSD maps of deposition cross-sections highlighted the change in temperature gradients as the melt pool increased in depth during keyhole and conduction mode depositions. Strong sub-surface temperature gradients were found for keyhole mode with weak gradients above the surface. In conduction mode variation in the temperature gradient throughout the melt pool was less pronounced. The decrease in cooling rate as the exposure time is increased was highlighted in coarsening of the cell spacing produced by the solute redistribution during solidification, diverging between bottom and dome of the deposition melt pool.},

Whilst this technology has proven very successful at solving steady-state problems via a Reynolds Averaged Navier\textendash Stokes approach, its utility for undertaking scale-resolving simulations of unsteady flows is less clear. High-order methods for unstructured grids and GPU accelerators have been proposed as an enabling technology for unsteady scale-resolving simulations of flow over complex geometries. In this study we systematically compare accuracy and cost of the high-order Flux Reconstruction solver PyFR running on GPUs and the industry-standard solver STAR-CCM+ running on CPUs when applied to a range of unsteady flow problems. Specifically, we perform comparisons of accuracy and cost for isentropic vortex advection (EV), decay of the Taylor\textendash Green vortex (TGV), turbulent flow over a circular cylinder, and turbulent flow over an SD7003 aerofoil. We consider two configurations of STAR-CCM+: a second-order configuration, and a third-order configuration, where the latter was recommended by CD-adapco for more effective computation of unsteady flow problems. Results from both PyFR and STAR-CCM+ demonstrate that third-order schemes can be more accurate than second-order schemes for a given cost e.g. going from second- to third-order, the PyFR simulations of the EV and TGV achieve 75\texttimes{} and 3\texttimes{} error reduction respectively for the same or reduced cost, and STAR-CCM+ simulations of the cylinder recovered wake statistics significantly more accurately for only twice the cost. Moreover, advancing to higher-order schemes on GPUs with PyFR was found to offer even further accuracy vs. cost benefits relative to industry-standard tools.},

Additive manufacturing techniques, such as laser powder bed fusion, have been utilized and aim towards further optimization of their mechanical properties. However, processing challenges exist for these promising alloys, mainly due to their crack susceptibility as recently shown in the Co-free Al-Cr-Fe-Ni alloy. In this study, gas atomized prealloyed powder of a baseline Al-Cr-Fe-Ni high-entropy alloy was mixed with Fe and Ni elemental fine powder particles, to produce a powder blend with a modified composition. It was aimed to improve the alloy processability via designing the solidification path by reducing the Al content. The synthesized novel alloy composition was processed by laser powder bed fusion and crack-free material with a metastable, near single-phase face-centered cubic microstructure was obtained. Process parameters for minimum porosity were identified and net-shape tensile specimens were produced. Heat treatment led to a refined dual-phase microstructure consisting of face-centered cubic and body-centered cubic phases with promising mechanical properties, such as high tensile strength, reasonable elongation and notable strain hardening.},

  abstract = {A novel approach to surrogate modeling motivated by recent advancements in parameter dimension reduction is proposed. Specifically, the approach aims to speed-up surrogate modeling for mapping multiple input variables to a field quantity of interest. Computational efficiency is accomplished by first identifying principal components (PC) and corresponding features in the output field data. A map from inputs to each feature is considered, and the active subspace (AS) methodology is used to capture their relationship in a low-dimensional subspace in the input domain. Thus, the PCAS method accomplishes dimension reduction in the input as well as the output. The method is demonstrated on a realistic problem pertaining to variability in residual stress in an additively manufactured component due to the stochastic nature of the process variables and material properties. The resulting surrogate model is exploited for uncertainty propagation, and identification of stress hotspots in the part. Additionally, the surrogate model is used for global sensitivity analysis to quantify relative contributions of the uncertain inputs to stress variability. Our findings based on the considered application are indicative of enormous potential for computational gains in such analyses, especially in generating training data, and enabling advancements in control and optimization of additive manufacturing processes.},

  abstract = {Rapid solidification cellular structures are known to play a crucial role in helping achieve high strength and high ductility in 316L austenitic stainless steels fabricated by laser powder-bed-fusion (L-PBF). Despite this, the understanding of their intrinsic characteristics (e.g., crystallographic orientations, dislocations, precipitates, elemental segregations) and the respective impacts on the material's strength and thermal stability remains nebulous. We conduct several dedicated transmission electron microscopy (TEM) studies to investigate these strengthening mechanisms and identified that cell walls follow specific crystallographic orientations. The high density of tangled dislocations inside cell walls are found to have a higher tendency to dissociate, forming wider stacking faults while oxide precipitates are confined inside cell walls. These features act as barriers to moving dislocations upon plastic deformation and contribute to the high strength. Our dislocation dynamic simulations indicate that segregated particles are effective in blocking dislocations locally, helping the formation of dislocation cells and participating to the material strengthening. To study the thermal stability of L-PBF 316L SS, we perform systematic post-processing heat treatments from 400-1200\textdegree C. Microstructure characterizations using electron backscatter diffraction, TEM, and synchrotron X-ray diffraction coupled with dislocation dynamics and CALPHAD simulations and tensile testing reveal three heat treatment zones where the structure-property relationship can be tuned. After annealing up to 600\textdegree C, the microstructure remains stable; but the work hardening behavior is altered with a material that retains high strength and high ductility. Annealing between 600-1000\textdegree C activates elemental diffusion and gradual disappearance of cell walls, leading to a sharp drop in yield strength and a tradeoff between strength and ductility. Low-angle grain boundaries remain stable up to 1000\textdegree C while the average grain size defined by high angle grain boundaries is near constant at annealing temperatures up to 800\textdegree C. Annealing above 1100\textdegree C removes all L-PBF microstructure footprints and renders a conventional-like microstructure. Compared to conventional materials, L-PBF 316LSS displays substantially higher thermal stability and superior performance at elevated temperatures.},

Four cracking models were implemented, and one alloy designed for reduced cracking susceptibility was deduced based on each cracking criterion. The criteria were modeled using CALPHAD-based Scheil calculations. The alloys were designed using a previously developed multi-criteria optimization tool. The commercial superalloy Mar-M247 was chosen as the reference material. The alloys were fabricated by arc melting, then remelted with laser and electron beam, and the cracking was assessed. After electron beam melting, solidification cracks were more prevalent than cold cracks, and vice versa. The alloys exhibited vastly different crack densities ranging from 0 to nearly 12 mm-1. DSC measurements showed good qualitative agreement with the calculated transition temperatures. It was found that the cracking mechanisms differed strongly depending on the process temperature. A correlation analysis of the measured crack densities and the modeled cracking susceptibilities showed no clear positive correlation for any crack model, indicating that none of these models alone is sufficient to describe the cracking behavior of the alloys. One experimental alloy showed an improved cracking resistance during electron beam melting, suggesting that further development of the optimization-based alloy design approach could lead to the discovery of new crack-resistant superalloys.},

We observe a hierarchical microstructure spanning over different length scales, consisting of remelted zones and track core regions at the macro-scale, regions with elongated columnar grains and equiaxed grains at the micro-scale, martensitic laths at the submicron-scale, and a high density of dislocations and stacking faults at the nano- and atomic scale. The hierarchical microstructure leads to the outstanding tensile properties of the as-prepared SLM and SLM annealed samples (with yield strength, ultimate tensile strength and fracture strain of \textasciitilde{} 735~MPa, \textasciitilde{} 1211~MPa and \textasciitilde{} 12.8\%, and \textasciitilde{} 893~MPa, \textasciitilde{} 1214~MPa and \textasciitilde{} 13.8\%, respectively). The mechanisms determining the strength and ductility are discussed in terms of the hierarchical microstructure and internal defects. The cellular structure with a high density of dislocations along their boundaries and the martensitic structure are the reasons for strengthening, while the hierarchical microstructure helps to obtain appropriate ductility. Furthermore, martensitic transformation induced plastic bending of the residual FCC plates was confirmed, which is helpful to maintain the different plastic strain between the heterogeneous structure. The development of the martensitic structure in this Co\textendash Cr\textendash Mo alloy by SLM and its characteristic hierarchical microstructure are promising features for material design and application of high-strength materials with improved strength-ductility tradeoff.},

Compared to the monolithic CoCrFeMnNi printing process, a higher energy density input is shown to produce a synergic combination of Marangoni flow and capillary force in the laser-generated melt pool. It facilitates the enhancement of wettability, and hence a more uniform distribution of the reinforcement material and a high degree of densification of 99.72\%, which are able to delay the early fracture of the material. The as-deposited composites exhibit improved yield strength, surpassing that of the monolithic HEA by 42\%. The enhanced strength is mainly ascribed to dispersion strengthening. Besides, the refined grain size, the increased dislocation density, and the additional load transfer effect also contribute to the strength enhancement. Furthermore, the wear resistance properties of the CoCrFeMnNi/TiB2 composite are also shown to be superior to those of the CoCrFeMnNi, indicating a decrease in friction coefficient by 22.4\%. The enhanced tribological properties are attributed to the synergic effect of high-hardness and self-lubrication of TiB2 nanoparticles.

The challenge of this problem is that we only know the scanned material data in the spatial configuration and the shape of the design configuration of three-dimensional (3D) printed products, whereas for a specific scanned material point we do not know its corresponding material coordinates in the initial or designed referential configuration, provided that we do not know the detailed information on actual physical deformation process. Different from physics-based modeling, the method developed here is a data-driven artificial intelligence method, which solves the problem with incomplete deformation data or with missing information of actual physical deformation process. We coined the method is an AI-based material deformation finding algorithm.  This method has practical significance and important applications in finding and designing thermal compensation configuration of a 3D printed product in additive manufacturing, which is at the heart of the cutting edge 3D printing technology. In this paper, we demonstrate that the proposed AI continuum/material deformation finding approach can accurately find permanent thermal deformation configuration for a complex 3D printed structure component, and hence to identify the thermal compensation design configuration in order to minimizing the impact of temperature fluctuations on 3D printed structure components that are sensitive to changes of temperature.},

However, surface defects generated during the AM process have an adverse effect on surface quality. Although some studies have explored the defect features based on the processing of information including images, acoustic signals, thermal history, etc., they focus mainly on defect classification or one type of defect detection. Over recent years, convolution neural networks have displayed promising performance in object detection in images in various fields. Therefore, in this paper, to detect and characterize surface defects more comprehensively and accurately, a novel defect detection model based on CenterNet is presented to extract the defect features, including type, location and count simultaneously, in which there are four output heads to predict heatmaps, object size, local offset, and density map, respectively. Moreover, count loss is added in the original objective function to boost the detection performance. To perform the model validation, surface defect dataset is captured through scanning electron microscope on the surfaces of the workpiece made of 316L fabricated by AM. A series of experiments was conducted and the proposed model achieved better detection accuracy on defect dataset compared with other state-of-the-art models.},

Electron microscopy study reveals that the L-PBF-processed Al7075-Nb sample contains a high density of Al3Nb and MgZn2 precipitates. The intra-granular Al3Nb particles were found to show coherent orientation relationships with the matrix and should have acted as potent heterogeneous nucleation inoculants. A high population of Al3Nb particles were also distributed along grain boundaries which may have impeded grain growth during L-PBF. The ultrafine MgZn2 precipitates which have a lower melting point than the matrix is believed to have formed during thermal cycling of L-PBF. The Al7075-Nb samples demonstrate high yield strength and decent ductility. Transmission electron microscopy study reveals that during deformation, the relatively larger Al3Nb particles were looped around by dislocations whereas the relatively smaller MgZn2 particles have been cut through by dislocations.

In this study, laser directed energy deposition (DED) was applied to investigate the feasibility of in-situ alloying of Inconel 625 using elemental powders. Three levels of laser scanning speed were used to illustrate its effects on the microstructure and mechanical properties of in-situ alloyed samples. It was discovered that the lower laser scanning speed favors uniform in-situ alloying. At the lowest scanning speed adopted, the existence of unmelted particles is almost negligible. Moreover, at the as-built state, the in-situ alloyed Inconel 625 obtained at the lowest laser scanning speed has an averaged ultimate tensile strength of 1020~MPa, and an averaged fracture strain of 23.14\%, comparable to those obtained using pre-alloyed powders under the same DED process condition. Meanwhile, its micro-hardness is 339 HV, higher than that made by pre-alloyed powders (298 HV). Microstructure characterization was also performed to reveal the underlying mechanism of in-situ alloying. This study not only demonstrates that quality Inconel 625 components can be additively manufactured through in-situ alloying from elemental powders, but also provides insights on alloy development using the flexible, high-throughput approach.},

The LPBF-built Al\textendash 15Fe alloy sample exhibited a microstructure consisting of a number of melt pools in which regions had locally melted and rapidly solidified due to scanning laser irradiation during the LPBF process. The {$\alpha$}-Al (fcc) matrix consists of a number of elongated grains with a mean size of approximately 10~{$\mu$}m. These microstructural features correspond well to previous results of Al alloys additively manufactured by the LPBF process. It was found that relatively coarsened stable \texttheta -Al13Fe4 phases with a length of a few micrometers were localized along the melt pool boundaries. Numerous spherical particles of a metastable Al\textendash Fe intermetallic phase were finely distributed within the nanoscale eutectic microstructure consisting of {$\alpha$}-Al and metastable Al6Fe phases inside the melt pools. The metastable phase formation corresponds well to the previous results on the rapidly solidified Al\textendash Fe alloys. The refined multiple intermetallic phases produced by the LPBF process contribute to a high hardness of approximately 200 HV. The refined microstructure appeared stable at an elevated temperature of 300~\textdegree C. The high microstructural stability would sustain sufficient strength in a hostile environment for long-term periods of service at elevated temperatures above 200~\textdegree C.

The emerging Cloud Manufacturing paradigm makes it much easier to access various AM resources with minimum investment. Distributed recourses can also be utilised more efficiently. However, the current cloud platforms mainly focus on providing simple 3D printing services, rather than support the customers throughout the product development process, from design, to process planning, and to printing. Therefore, a new cloud platform is proposed to integrate not only hard resources such as 3D printers and materials, but also soft resources such as the know-how and test data to provide supports on printing as well as design and process planning. Internet of Things provides new capabilities to the cloud platform, enabling customers to remotely control and monitor the printing process. The paper also examined the feasibility of Artificial Neural Networks for surface defect detection. The platform is able to work in dynamic and iterative product development processes and reduce development time and cost. An illustrative platform is developed to demonstrate the functionalities.},

  abstract = {Purpose Selective laser melting (SLM) is a major additive manufacturing (AM) process in which laser beams are used as the heat source to melt and deposit metals in a layerwise fashion to enable the construction of components of arbitrary complexity. The purpose of this paper is to develop a framework for accurate and fast prediction of the temperature distribution during the SLM process.Design/methodology/approach A fast computation tool is proposed for thermal analysis of the SLM process. It is based on the finite volume method (FVM) and the quiet element method to allow the development of customized functionalities at the source level. The results obtained from the proposed FVM approach are compared against those obtained from the finite element method (FEM) using a well-established commercial software, in terms of accuracy and efficiency.Findings The results show that for simulating the SLM deposition of a cubic block with 81,000, 189,000 and 297,000 cells, the computation takes about 767, 3,041 and 7,054\,min, respectively, with the FEM approach; while 174, 679 and 1,630\,min with the FVM code. This represents a speedup of around 4.4x. Meanwhile, the average temperature difference between the two is below 6\%, indicating good agreement between them.Originality/value The thermal field for the multi-track and multi-layer SLM process is for the first time computed by the FVM approach. This pioneering work on comparing FVM and FEM for SLM applications implies that a fast and simple computing tool for thermal analysis of the SLM process is within the reach, and it delivers comparable accuracy with significantly higher computational efficiency. The research results lay the foundation for a potentially cost-effective tool for investigating the fundamental microstructure evolution, and also optimizing the process parameters in the SLM process.},

In this study, 2024Al and 1.3-wt\% Zr-modified 2024Al alloy deposits were prepared by L-PBF using pre-alloyed powder. The solidification cracking susceptibility of the 1.3-wt\% Zr-modified 2024Al alloy was reduced to {$\sim$}0.4 of that of the 2024Al alloy. Compared to the complete columnar {$\alpha$}-Al grain microstructure in the 2024Al deposit, the crack-free Zr-modified 2024Al deposit exhibited a heterogeneous grain structure having columnar {$\alpha$}-Al grains in the inner region of the molten pool and ultrafine {$\alpha$}-Al equiaxed grains at the fusion boundary. Based on the time-dependent nucleation theory and constitutional undercooling analysis ahead of solidification interface, the precipitation behavior of primary Al3Zr nanoparticles is analyzed, and it is deduced that the high intensity of effective nucleation sites by nanosized primary Al3Zr at the fusion boundary of molten pool leads to the formation of equiaxed grains at the beginning of the solidification of molten pool. The as-deposited Zr-modified 2024Al exhibited a yield strength (YS) of {$\sim$}376\,{$\pm$}\,7\,MPa and an ultimate tensile strength (UTS) of 441\,{$\pm$}\,7\,MPa with an elongation of 14.1\,{$\pm$}\,1.6\%. The YS and UTS increased to 402\,{$\pm$}\,9\,MPa and 483\,{$\pm$}\,37\,MPa after T6 heat treatment, respectively.

In recent years machine learning tools are aspiring to introduce new effective ways of simulating PDEs, however existing approaches are not able to reliably return stable and accurate predictions across long temporal horizons. We aim to address this challenge by introducing an effective framework for learning infinite-dimensional operators that map random initial conditions to associated PDE solutions within a short time interval. Such latent operators can be parametrized by deep neural networks that are trained in an entirely self-supervised manner without requiring any paired input-output observations. Global long-time predictions across a range of initial conditions can be then obtained by iteratively evaluating the trained model using each prediction as the initial condition for the next evaluation step. This introduces a new approach to temporal domain decomposition that is shown to be effective in performing accurate long-time simulations for a wide range of parametric ODE and PDE systems, from wave propagation, to reaction-diffusion dynamics and stiff chemical kinetics, all at a fraction of the computational cost needed by classical numerical solvers.},

The effect of laser-energy-input (EV) on the microstructure evolution and mechanical properties of the composites was systematically studied. The results showed that the hardly dissolved or reacted SiC nanoparticles tended to be distributed at the cell boundaries, significantly refining the matrix grains by the promotion of heterogeneous nucleation process and the Zener pinning effect. However, the weak metallurgical bonding and the formation of Al4C3 phase caused a detrimental impact to tensile properties. On the contrary, the consumption of SiC nanoparticles at higher EV significantly enhanced the strength and elongation to fracture of the composites through the homogenization of microstructure, better metallurgical bonding, and the joint action of SiC/Al4SiC4/Al interface. Specifically, the AlSi10Mg/SiC composite prepared at 210~W presented excellent mechanical performance (131.7 HV0.1 for hardness, 101~GPa for modulus, and 440~MPa for strength) with a good ductility (7.4\%).},

Powder size distribution (PSD) is an important parameter governing the densification of powders and the overall quality of as-built S-DMLS parts. Therefore, this work aims to reveal the underlying mechanism of layer-by-layer powder compact densification during the S-DMLS with different PSDs via a multi-scale computational framework: 1) a powder-based 3D heat transfer simulation is conducted to predict the thermal response at the macroscale during laser heating; 2) the obtained thermal information is input to a non-isothermal phase-field model to simulate the sintering behavior of powder particles in a layer-by-layer manner at the mesoscale. Using stainless steel 316\,L as an example, a narrow PSD presents a small volume of gap between powders with an elevated effective thermal conductivity, causing a deep laser-induced heating zone that promotes full grain coalescence and reduces porosity during the S-DMLS. Furthermore, a bimodal powder mixture with an optimized size ratio can also effectively reduce the porosity of as-built S-DMLS parts. Moreover, the effect of layer-wise manufacturing on the densification is comprehensively explored. Finally, the influences of laser beam size and scanning speed are discussed.},

Using the FEM data, we identify a novel surrogate system model from the laser power to the melt pool width. Linking a linearized model with a memory-less nonlinear submodel, we develop a physics-based Hammer-stein model that captures the complex spatiotemporal thermomechanical dynamics. We verify the accuracy of the Hammerstein model using the FEM and prove that the linearized model is only a representation of the Hammerstein model around the equilibrium point. Along the way, we conduct the stability and robustness analyses and formalize the Hammerstein model to facilitate the subsequent control designs.},

The powder packing pattern and powder bed void fraction were estimated by an advancing front method and the technique of image analysis. The effects of powder bed characteristics on the material properties were considered by analytical models with solid properties and powder bed void fraction as inputs. A physics-based thermal model was utilized to calculate the temperature distribution and molten pool size. The molten pool cross section in transvers direction was assumed to be dual half-elliptical. Based on this assumption and molten pool size, the geometry of the molten pool cross section with cap area was determined. The overlapping pattern of molten pools in adjacent scan tracks and layers was then obtained with given hatch space and layer thickness. The lack-of-fusion area fraction was obtained through image analysis of the overlapping pattern. The lack-of-fusion porosity was the multiplication of the lack-of-fusion area fraction and powder bed void fraction. The predictions of porosity under different process conditions were compared with experimental results of 316L stainless steel and showed a better predictive accuracy than the predictions that did not consider cap area. The proposed analytical modeling method has no numerical calculations, which ensures its low computational cost. Thus, the proposed model can be a convenient tool for the fast computation of lack-of-fusion-induced porosity and can help the quality control in LPBF.},

The temperature distribution of the part was first predicted by an analytical thermal model, which consists of a linear heat source solution and a heat sink solution. The temperature increase due to laser power input was calculated by the point moving heat source solution. The temperature drop due to thermal conduction, convection, and radiation at part boundaries was calculated by the heat sink solution. The coefficient of laser power absorption was inversely obtained by comparing predicted molten pool widths with experimental measurements. The lack-of-fusion area was then calculated by plotting molten pool shapes of multi-tracks and multi-layers on a transverse cross-sectional area of the part. The powder bed porosity was calculated by an advancing front method with the consideration of powder size distribution and packing pattern. Finally, the lack-of-fusion porosity was obtained by multiplying the lack-of-fusion area with powder bed porosity. The predicted results were close to the measurements of Ti6Al4V in LPBF. The maximum deviation for porosity prediction is 5.91\%. The presented model shows high computational efficiency without relying on iteration-based numerical method. The computational time for five consecutive layers is less than 100 s. The acceptable accuracy, short computational time, and the ability to consider complex boundary effects make the proposed method a good basis for future research and a promising tool for optimization of process parameters in LPBF of complex parts.},

  abstract = {The strain rate dependence of mechanical property in a selective laser melted (SLM) 17\textendash 4 precipitation hardening (PH) stainless steel with different states was investigated systematically by microstructure characterization, texture measurement and tensile test in the present study. The results reveal that as-built and annealed specimens have different initial microstructure and show the strain rate dependence of mechanical property, and their microstructure and texture have great changes during tensile deformation. Before tensile deformation, both as-built and annealed specimens are comprised of mixed grain structure, texture along building direction and dual austenite and martensite phases, however, the latter contains a larger amount of martensite phase. No matter as-built specimen or annealed specimen, the yield strength, ultimate tensile strength and elongation increase with the increase of strain rate. In contrast to the as-built specimen, the annealed specimen exhibits the higher ultimate tensile strength, but lower elongation at the corresponding strain rate, and the higher strain rate sensitivity. After the tensile deformation, the completely different microstructure and texture were developed including finer grain structure, more high angle grain boundaries (HAGBs), new texture along tensile direction and more martensite phase. There is a significant austenite-to-martensite phase transformation during tensile deformation. No matter as-built specimen or annealed specimen subjected to tensile deformation, the grain size, HAGBs and texture almost have no change with the increase of strain rate, but the phase transformation degree changes a lot.},

To study the molten pool dynamics under an external magnetic field, a thermoelectric magnetohydrodynamic (TEMHD) model is developed by incorporating the electrodynamic model with the Seebeck effect into the multiphysics thermal-fluid flow model. The Seebeck effect in the molten pool is analyzed with the simulation of stationary laser melting on a bare plate. Furthermore, different external magnetic fields are assigned in the TEMHD simulations with the stationary laser melting and the results show that the Lorentz force can damp the keyhole fluctuations. Finally, the laser scanning simulations on a bare plate under external magnetic fields indicate that the Lorentz force can smooth the fluid flow fields in the molten pool and increase the ratio of equiaxed grains in the solidification front.},

  abstract = {During powder production, the pre-alloyed powder composition often deviates from the target composition leading to undesirable properties of additive manufacturing (AM) components. Therefore, we developed a method to perform high-throughput calculation and uncertainty quantification by using a CALPHAD-based ICME framework (CALPHAD: calculations of phase diagrams, ICME: integrated computational materials engineering) to optimize the composition, and took the high-strength low-alloy steel (HSLA) as a case study. We analyzed the process-structure-property relationships for 450,000 compositions around the nominal composition of HSLA-115. Properties that are critical for the performance, such as yield strength, impact transition temperature, and weldability, were evaluated to optimize the composition. With the same uncertainty as the initial composition, a new targeting average composition has been determined, which increased the probability of achieving successful AM builds by 47\%. The present strategy is general and can be applied to other alloy composition optimization to expand the choices of alloy for additive manufacturing. Such a method also calls for high-quality CALPHAD database and predictive ICME models.},

  abstract = {Uncertainty quantification (UQ) in metal additive manufacturing (AM) has attracted tremendous interest in order to dramatically improve product reliability. Model-based UQ, which relies on the validity of a computational model, has been widely explored as a potential substitute for the time-consuming and expensive UQ solely based on experiments. However, its adoption in the practical AM process requires overcoming two main challenges: (1) the inaccurate knowledge of uncertainty sources and (2) the intrinsic uncertainty associated with the computational model. Here, we propose a data-driven framework to tackle these two challenges by combining high throughput physical/surrogate model simulations and the AM-Bench experimental data from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). We first construct a surrogate model, based on high throughput physical simulations, for predicting the three-dimensional (3D) melt pool geometry and its uncertainty with respect to AM parameters and uncertainty sources. We then employ a sequential Bayesian calibration method to perform experimental parameter calibration and model correction to significantly improve the validity of the 3D melt pool surrogate model. The application of the calibrated melt pool model to UQ of the porosity level, an important quality factor, of AM parts, demonstrates its potential use in AM quality control. The proposed UQ framework can be generally applicable to different AM processes, representing a significant advance toward physics-based quality control of AM products.},

  abstract = {Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have lately received great attention thanks to their flexibility in tackling a wide range of forward and inverse problems involving partial differential equations. However, despite their noticeable empirical success, little is known about how such constrained neural networks behave during their training via gradient descent. More importantly, even less is known about why such models sometimes fail to train at all. In this work, we aim to investigate these questions through the lens of the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK); a kernel that captures the behavior of fully-connected neural networks in the infinite width limit during training via gradient descent. Specifically, we derive the NTK of PINNs and prove that, under appropriate conditions, it converges to a deterministic kernel that stays constant during training in the infinite-width limit. This allows us to analyze the training dynamics of PINNs through the lens of their limiting NTK and find a remarkable discrepancy in the convergence rate of the different loss components contributing to the total training error. To address this fundamental pathology, we propose a novel gradient descent algorithm that utilizes the eigenvalues of the NTK to adaptively calibrate the convergence rate of the total training error. Finally, we perform a series of numerical experiments to verify the correctness of our theory and the practical effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.

Considering the multi-track multi-layer nature of an actual SLM process, an investigation of thermal behavior and melt pool morphology in multi-track multi-layer SLM of the 316L steel is presented in this paper. The SLM process of a four-layer component with multiple tracks was modeled. Element birth and death technique was used to simulate the layer built-up process. The established FEM model was used to investigate the variations in thermal variables and melt pool morphology with increasing number of layers. Moreover, the influence of various processing parameters in a multi-track multi-layer SLM was also studied. The results show that maximum melt pool temperature, melt pool width, and melt pool depth increase with increasing number of layers, whereas heating rates and cooling rates decrease with increasing number of layers. Compared with the previous layer, melt pool lifetime was observed to have a decreasing trend for layer 2 and increasing trend for layers 3 and 4. An increase in melt pool depth and decrease in melt pool width was observed by increasing hatch spacing. Furthermore, it was found that increasing laser power and scanning speeds both increase the heating and cooling rates.},

The smaller-sized regions (3 mm x 4 mm) in the combinatorial sample have a lower hardness compared to a larger regular sample (20 mm x 20 mm) with similar porosity ({$<$} 0.03 \%).

Laser spot size is one critical parameter that is less well studied for scaling laws compared to laser power and scan speed. Consequently, single track laser scans were generated with a spot size (D4{$\sigma$}) range of 50~{$\mu$}m to 322~{$\mu$}m and melt pool aspect ratio (depth over spot radius) range from 0.1 to 7.0. These were characterized by in-situ thermography, cross-sectioning, and optical microscopy. Scaling laws from literature were applied and evaluated based on melt pool depth predictions. Scaling laws that contain a minimum of three dimensionless parameters and account for changing absorption between conduction and keyhole mode provide the most accurate melt pool depth predictions ({$<$}35\% difference from experiments), which is comparable to thermal simulation results from literature for a select number of cases.},

These include but are not limited to directionally dependent grain and phase morphology; crystallographic texture; directional porosity/defects; and heterogeneity associated with the melt pool, layer-wise microstructure. All of these are prevalent in most additive manufacturing processes, and it is difficult to separate out the role that each play in the mechanical anisotropy. This review focuses on studies that have attempted to or reasonably isolate one or two of these sources rather than simply report on trends in mechanical properties. This is not an exhaustive review covering all additive process or mechanical properties; the main assessment is on laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) metals and tensile test results (modulus, yield strength, ultimate tensile strength, elongation, and fracture surface analysis). In summary, the primary sources of anisotropic tensile properties for LPBF alloys are crystallographic texture, anisotropic microstructure morphologies, lack of fusion defects, and the melt pool macrostructure. Within anisotropic microstructures, elongated grains appear to be secondary compared to the preferential distribution of phases and features (e.g., grain boundary alpha, precipitates, etc.). Anisotropic modulus and yield strength are primarily caused by crystallographic texture. This is supported by crystal plasticity simulations.},

Three phases were found across the graded coupon, i.e., face centered cubic (FCC), body centered cubic (BCC) solid solutions, and intermetallic B2. The phase variations can be attributed to the Al-induced lattice distortion and valence electron concentration.

In this work, a comprehensive phenomenological model was developed to compute the complex transport phenomena during laser PBF of Ti-6Al-4V. The transient temperature and velocity fields during single-track and multi-track laser PBF were computed considering the melting and solidification of the powder feedstocks. Critical metallurgical variables including the molten pool characteristics and thermal cycles were obtained. The model was validated by comparing the computed results against corresponding experimental data. The formation and evolution of inter-track voids in different heat input conditions were studied. Two types of inter-track voids were specified considering their formation mechanisms. The first type appeared in irregular elongated shapes and was caused by the incomplete melting of the powder feedstocks. The second type appeared in near-spherical shapes and originated from the bubbles trapped in the overlap zone of adjacent tracks. Cooling rates were obtained to interpret the metallurgical conditions for the solid-state phase transformations. The novel findings from this research are helpful to the understanding of the formation and mitigation of inter-track voids, and the assessment of phase transformations during laser PBF of titanium alloys.},

Its implementation utilizes the parallelization capabilities of Graphics Processing Units (GPU) for achieving a reduced computation time. Physical phenomena such as thermal conduction, melting and re-solidification, convection and effects related to surface tension such as thermocapillarity are considered. Furthermore, the influence of the recoil pressure induced by evaporating atoms from the melt pool surface is taken into account. The material properties of relevance (e.g. dynamic viscosity, thermal conductivity and absorptivity) for the investigated alloy Inconel\textregistered ~718 (respectively Alloy~718) are modeled by means of temperature-dependent functions. The underlying material data originate from literature. The simulation results are compared with experimental findings for single melt tracks to evaluate the model validity with regard to the process parameters scanning velocity and laser power.},

The additions are among those that increase freezing ranges such that significant solutal undercooling results when combined with the rapid cooling rates associated with AM, and so be effective in inducing a columnar-to-equiaxed transition (CET). Firstly, computational thermodynamics has been used to provide a simple graphical means of predicting these additions; this method has been used to explore additions of Ni and Fe to the alloy Ti\textendash 6Al\textendash 4V (Ti64). Secondly, an experimental means of determining the minimum concentration of these alloying elements required to effect the CET has been developed involving gradient builds. Thirdly, it has been found that additions of Fe to Ti64 cause the alloy to change from an {$\alpha$}/{$\beta$} Ti alloy to being a metastable {$\beta$}-Ti alloy, whereas additions of Ni do not produce the same result. This change in type of Ti alloy results in a marked difference in the development of microstructures of these compositionally modified alloys using heat treatments. Finally, hardness measurements have been used to provide a preliminary assessment of the mechanical response of these modified alloys.},

Under processing conditions that result in high energy densities, fluid flow driven by Marangoni effects influences the uncertainty in solidification dynamics and melt pool dimensions which affect the as-built microstructure and scan strategies development. Using a computational fluid dynamics model for melt pool predictions of Inconel 625, and applying sparse grids and interpolation techniques, the uncertainty in input parameters including thermophysical properties and the surface tension gradient can be propagated to predictions of cooling rates and melt pool geometries. Results show the uncertainty in surface tension gradient had the largest effect on melt pool dimensions, whereas uncertainty in laser absorptivity and specific heat capacity were the most influential on the solidification dynamics.},

However, the distortion and swelling in the SLM process resulting from thermal stress cannot be predicted subject to measurement. In this work, an in situ distortion measurement system applied to the SLM process is presented. The distortion behaviour of component under laser scanning can be precisely recorded in real-time by this system. The detailed evolution and driving force of specimen distortion in the SLM process are discussed based on the experimental results. The distortion in single laser scanning presents a strong instantaneous upward motion of the central section during laser heating and a relatively slow downward recovery motion of the central section during cooling. The distortion behaviour of the sample with and without a layer of metal powder are compared, and laser scanning on the bare sample surface leads to a significantly higher residual distortion. The influence of SLM parameter variables (such as scanning speed, laser power, scanning width, layer thickness and scanning times) on SLM distortion is also analysed. At last, the stress distribution of laser melting is verified by the highresolution EBSD analysis.},

This study assesses the current capabilities of commercially available CALPHAD databases to predict phase equilibria within ternary phase space as a function of the number of full binary system descriptions contained within the thermodynamic databases, the spatial location in compositional space relative to subsystem descriptions, and the specific database used. A strong correlation was observed between the fraction of subsystem descriptions available for the free energy calculation and the accuracy of phase predictions in undefined ternary space. The accuracy of equilibria predictions degraded with increased compositional extrapolation from defined subsystems.},

  abstract = {Numerical simulation is indispensable in industrial design processes. It can replace expensive experiments and even reduce the need for prototypes. While products designed with the aid of numerical simulation undergo continuous improvement, this must also be true for numerical simulation itself. Up to date, no general purpose numerical method is available which can accurately resolve a variety of physics ranging from fluid to solid mechanics including large deformations and free surface flow phenomena. These complex multi-physics problems occur for example in Additive Manufacturing processes. In this sense, the recent developments in Machine Learning display promise for numerical simulation. It has recently been shown that instead of solving a system of equations as in standard numerical methods, a neural network can be trained solely based on initial and boundary conditions. Neural networks are smooth, differentiable functions that can be used as a global ansatz for Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). While this idea dates back to more than 20 years ago [Lagaris et al., 1998], it is only recently that an approach for the solution of time dependent problems has been developed [Raissi et al., 2019]. With the latter, implicit Runge Kutta schemes with unprecedented high order have been constructed to solve scalar-valued PDEs. We build on the aforementioned work in order to develop an Updated Lagrangian method for the solution of incompressible free surface flow subject to the inviscid Euler equations. The method is easy to implement and does not require any specific algorithmic treatment which is usually necessary to accurately resolve the incompressibility constraint. Due to its meshfree character, we will name it the Neural Particle Method (NPM). It will be demonstrated that the NPM remains stable and accurate even if the location of discretization points is highly irregular.},

Additionally, Bayesian inference is employed to predict distributions for the E\textendash T model input parameters of laser absorptivity and powder bed porosity by incorporating experimental results into the analysis. Monte Carlo uncertainty propagation is then used with these parameter distributions to estimate the melt pool depth and associated uncertainty. Our results for the 316L stainless steel suggest that both the absorptivity and powder bed porosity are strongly influenced by the laser power. In contrast, the scanning speed has only a marginal effect on both the absorptivity and powder bed porosity. We constructed a printability map using the Bayesian E\textendash T model based on power-dependent input parameter values to demonstrate the merit of the approach. The Bayesian approach improved the accuracy in predicting the keyhole regions in the laser power-scan speed parameter space for the 316L stainless steel. Although applied to a specific adaptation of the E\textendash T model, the method put forth can be extended to quantify uncertainties in other numerical models as well as in the estimation of unknown parameters.},

A simplified FE modelling methodology has been developed and applied to a cylindrical component built in both the horizontal and vertical orientations. The resulting distortion of the parts following a slitting process was compared with those predicted by the model and good agreement to within 5\% was found.

Herein, all relevant details and derivation considering the Marangoni effect are provided and validated by means of a benchmark problem by comparing the obtained results with the available analytical solution, with the results obtained from a commercial CFD tool and with the results of other authors. The modified solver is additionally validated by comparing the results from LPBF simulations with experimental data. Furthermore, the influence of the surface tension modeling on the mushy region is investigated. The optimized implementation shows improvements of the simulation results in both the dimensions and shape of the melt pool and the resulting surface with regard to the experimental data.},

  abstract = {Al-Li alloys printed by laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) have huge potential for industrial application due to their remarkable advantages. However, the high hot cracking susceptibility (HCS) due to the addition of Li is still a key restraining factor for their rapid development towards such industrial application. Here in this report, hot cracking behaviour of 2195 Al-Li alloys fabricated by LPBF process was investigated by a three-dimensional (3D) X-ray micro-tomography technique. The relationship between the microstructural evolution and the high HCS was established to reveal the hot cracking mechanism for the first time. Observations by X-ray tomography showed large, interconnected cracks with a 3D reticular structure in the printed samples, extending layer by layer from the lamellar cracks in the previous single tracks along the building direction. Contributions to hot cracking were found to origin from the stable liquid film and the stress concentration. The segregation between the Al6CuLi3 and {$\alpha$}-Al matrix contributed to the Al-Cu eutectics along the high-angle grain boundaries in form of intergranular liquid films. Furthermore, it was found that the interfacial layer (intradendritic liquid film) between the Al2Cu and the adjacent LiAlSi or AlCuMgAg exhibited the reduced micro-crack resistance in the interior of the grains. It was pointed out on the basis of the calculation that the higher stability of the intergranular liquid film led to a higher HCS at the grain boundaries as compared to that in the interior of the grains. Furthermore, high internal residual tensile stress provided the driving force for the crack initiation and propagation. In summary, this work contains a practical guide to optimize the powder composition and processing steps of high-quality Al-Li alloys produced by LPBF.},

Results show that the microstructure of TA15 sample is composed of acicular {$\alpha{'}$} martensites within the columnar prior {$\beta$} grain. During manufacturing process of LPBF, the non-equilibrium heating and cooling of the thermal cycles experiencing different peak temperatures result in the hierarchical structure of martensite.

Therefore, an integrated simulation approach incorporating stochastic powder deposition and subsequently selective melting is developed to understand the consolidation mechanism in a multilayer process of electron beam~PBF additive manufacturing. Simulation results of a thin-walled cross section are validated with the published experimental data to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model. The simulation results of the multilayer process revealed that the layer thickness keeps on slight changes until reaching a steady state during the multilayer additive process. The stable powder layer thickness is systematically analyzed, which proved that the influence of the wall effect should be considered in smaller nominal layer thickness and denser powder bed. Finally, the printing quality in the multilayer process is dependent on adequate inter- and intra-layer bonding when the layer thickness reaches its maximum value, where agglomeration and balling effect in melt pool dynamics predominant by surface tension play crucial roles.},

Powder bed defects (PBDs) have different sizes and shapes and occur in different locations in the built area. Those variations pose great challenges to their detection. In this study, a deep convolution neural network was applied to detect three typical types of PBDs in a selective laser sintering (SLS) process, namely warpage, part shifting, and short feed, which were intentionally generated by varying the process conditions. Images of the powder bed were captured using a digital camera, which were split into three single-channel images corresponding to the color channels in the color image. A deep residual neural network was then used to extract multiscale features, and a region proposal network was adopted to detect the object-level defect bounding box. In the final stage, a fully convolutional neural network was proposed to generate instance-level defect regions in the bounding box. Our results demonstrated that this method had higher accuracy and efficiency and was able to cope with geometrical distortion and image blurring, in comparison to the defect detection methods reported previously. Also, the detection system was cost-effective and could be easily installed outside the chamber of a PBF system. This study lays the groundwork for the development of a variety of automated technologies for additive manufacturing, such as real-time powder layer quality inspection and 3D quality certificate generation for finish parts.}

AM techniques afford significant opportunities in regard to nuclear materials, including an accelerated fabrication process and reduced cost. High-fidelity modeling and simulation (M\textbackslash\&S) of AM processes is being developed in Idaho National Laboratory (INL)'s Multiphysics Object-Oriented Simulation Environment (MOOSE) to support AM process optimization and provide a fundamental understanding of the various physical interactions involved. In this paper, we employ Bayesian inverse uncertainty quantification (UQ) to quantify the input uncertainties in a MOOSE-based melt pool model for AM. Inverse UQ is the process of inversely quantifying the input uncertainties while keeping model predictions consistent with the measurement data. The inverse UQ process takes into account uncertainties from the model, code, and data while simultaneously characterizing the uncertain distributions in the input parameters--rather than merely providing best-fit point estimates. We employ measurement data on melt pool geometry (lengths and depths) to quantify the uncertainties in several melt pool model parameters. Simulation results using the posterior uncertainties have shown improved agreement with experimental data, as compared to those using the prior nominal values. The resulting parameter uncertainties can be used to replace expert opinions in future uncertainty, sensitivity, and validation studies.},

The results show that the {$\alpha$} and {$\alpha{'}$} phases in the hexagonal close-packed (hcp) structure, as well as the residual {$\beta$} phase in the body centered cubic (bcc) structure, exist in both samples. However, different SLM build orientations led to varied cooling rates and {$\alpha$}/{$\alpha{'}$} ratios in the final materials.

Besides, minor martensitic ({$\alpha$}'') phase was observed in the SLM-1 alloy and acted as an intermediate phase between {$\beta$} and {$\alpha{'}$} phases. The low {$\alpha$}/{$\alpha{'}$} ratio and existence of {$\alpha$}'' phase in the SLM-1 alloy result in a relatively high tensile strength but deteriorated plasticity. Comparatively, the higher {$\alpha$}/{$\alpha{'}$} ratio in the SLM-2 alloy without {$\alpha$}'' martensite leads to a much better plasticity regardless of the slightly reduced tensile strength.},

Here, we propose an improved constitutive model based on a serial of stress relaxation experiments, which can descript the temperature and time-dependent stress relaxation behavior during AM. By using the proposed relaxation model, the prediction accuracy is significantly improved due to the recovery of inelastic strain during multilayer deposition. The results are validated by both in-situ and final distortion measurements. The influence mechanism of the relaxation behavior on material mechanical response is explained by the three-bar model in thermo-elastic-plastic theory. The relaxation behavior during the whole AM process is clarified. The stress behavior is found to have a limited effect when merely depositing several layers; nevertheless, it becomes a prominent impact when depositing multiple layers. The proposed model can enhance modeling accuracy both in AM and in multilayer welding.},

This study aims to reveal convection-modified grain evolution in the laser melting process, e.g., the selective laser melting AM. We use a process-microstructure model and systematically design comparative simulation cases (with and without convection flow) to identify the effects of convection flow on melt pool geometry, solidification conditions, and as-solidified grain structure formation. The model is validated by secondary electron images and electron backscatter diffraction of the laser melted IN625 alloy provided by NIST Additive Manufacturing Benchmark Test Series. It is found that the strong Marangoni convection flow can widen the melt pool and notably affect the solidified microstructure in terms of grain growth directions and bulk nucleation events.

  abstract = {Wire arc additive manufacturing (WAAM) provides a rapid and cost-effective solution for fabricating low-to-medium complexity and medium-to-large size metal parts. In WAAM, process settings are well-recognized as fundamental factors that determine the performance of the fabricated parts such as geometry accuracy and microstructure. However, decision-making on process variables for WAAM still heavily relies on knowledge from domain experts. For achieving reliable and automated production, process planning systems that can capture, store, and reuse knowledge are needed. This study proposes a process planning framework by integrating a WAAM knowledge base together with our in-house developed computer-aided tools. The knowledge base is construed with a data-knowledge-service structure to incorporate various data and knowledge including metamodels and planning rules.

  abstract = {Laser powder bed fusion is a promising additive manufacturing technique for the fabrication of NiTi shape memory alloy parts with complex geometries that are otherwise difficult to fabricate through traditional processing methods. The technique is particularly attractive for the biomedical applications of NiTi shape memory alloys, such as stents, implants, and dental and surgical devices, where primarily the superelastic effect is exploited. However, few additively manufactured NiTi parts have been reported to exhibit superelasticity under tension in the as-printed condition, without a post-fabrication heat treatment, due to either persistent porosity formation or brittleness from oxidation during printing, or both. In this study, NiTi parts were fabricated using laser powder bed fusion and consistently exhibited room temperature tensile superelasticity up to 6\% in the as-printed condition, almost twice the maximum reported value in the literature. This was achieved by eliminating porosity and cracks through the use of optimized processing parameters, carefully tailoring the evaporation of Ni from a Ni-rich NiTi powder feedstock, and controlling the printing chamber oxygen content. Crystallographic texture analysis demonstrated that the as-printed NiTi parts had a strong preferential texture for superelasticity, a factor that needs to be carefully considered when complex shaped parts are to be subjected to combined loadings. Transmission electron microscopy investigations revealed the presence of nano-sized oxide particles and Ni-rich precipitates in the as-printed parts, which play a role in the improved superelasticity by suppressing inelastic accommodation mechanisms for martensitic transformation.},

However, unexpected shaping and internal defects can occur when an inappropriate combination of process parameters are used in the LMD process. These problems need to be solved to ensure satisfactory printed parts when using LMD. This study uses response surface methodology and multi-objective gray wolf optimization algorithm to obtain the process parameters of a single track with excellent forming quality. The results show that the process parameters have an important impact on the forming quality, and a single track with a good shape and microstructure are formed when the obtained optimal process parameters be used. In addition, the effects of laser energy densities on the microstructure and microhardness of printed parts were also studied by contrast experiments. The results indicate that the microstructure of the printed parts changes and the sub-grain size decreases with the decrease of the laser energy density, which ultimately leads to an increase in its microhardness. This work provides guidance for the selection of process parameters for surface enhancement coatings and parts repair by the LMD process.},

The simulation makes use of Nimonic 263 alloy, TiO, TiO2 and Ti2O3 as the flux. The arc constriction and the reversed Marangoni convection are considered to be the two main factors for increasing penetration of A-TIG weld pool. And the simulated results show that the latter is the main factor for changing weld shapes. The surface tension temperature coefficient is sensitive to the active elements and affects the pattern of the fluid flow. By controlling the category and quantity of the active elements, different kinds of the weld shapes are obtained. The experimental result shows that increase of active flux on the weld bead tends to increase the penetration of the weld pool at first and then decreases steeply. This does not coincide with the simulated results. It is probably because part of the oxide in the flux is not totally decomposed when the flux reaches a critical value. The solid oxide particles in the weld pool act as the obstacles of the fluid flow and reduce the velocity of the flow.},

The phenomena of wetting, necking, and pores near the overlapping region in the parallel dual-laser molten pools are especially investigated. The simulated results show that the SPDLM process improves the re-melting rate of the molten pool and the wettability of the overlapping region of the SPDLM molten pool, reducing the probability of defects, especially the probability of lack of fusion. Due to the uniform temperature distribution in the overlapping region of the two tracks and the complete melting, the product quality at the overlapping region of the two molten pools can be better guaranteed when the interval between the parallel dual lasers is 2.5 times of the laser beam radius. The results suggest that the SPDLM technique together with appropriate process parameters can not only increase the printing efficiency, but also improve the surface quality of the overlapping area of the two molten pools. The simulated results also reveal the formation mechanisms of pore defects during the selective multi-laser melting process on a mesoscopic scale. This study shows that the proposed particle-scale CFD model provides a high fidelity approach to characterize the molten pool in the SPDLM process and, therefore, is helpful for the optimal process design for the selective multi-laser melting.},

Each process step is interlinked to each other and can affect the overall behavior of the succeeding steps. Therefore, it is vital to monitor each step individually, post-process, and establish a link among the data to develop an approach to quantify the defects via inline monitoring. This study focuses on using pre- and post-exposure powder bed image data and in situ melt pool monitoring (MPM) data to monitor the build's overall quality. Two convolutional neural networks have been trained to treat the pre and post-exposure images with a trained accuracy of 93.16\% and 96.20\%, respectively. The supervised machine-learning algorithm called ``support vector machine'' is used to classify and post-process the photodiodes data obtained from the MPM. A case study on ``benchmark part'' is presented to check the proposed algorithms' overall working and detect abnormalities at three different process steps (pre and post-exposure, MPM) individually. This study shows the potential of machine learning approaches to improve the overall reliability of the (L-PBF) process by inter-linking the different process steps.},

Despite all of the advancements, quality assurance, reliability, and lack of repeatability of the laser powder bed fusion process still hinder risk-averse industries from adopting it wholeheartedly. The process-induced defects or drifts can have a detrimental effect on the quality of the final part, which could lead to catastrophic failure of the finished part. It led to the development of in situ monitoring systems to effectively monitor the process signatures during printing. Nevertheless, post-processing of the in situ data and defect detection in an automated fashion are major challenges. Nowadays, many studies have been focused on incorporating machine learning approaches to solve this problem and develop a feedback control loop system to monitor the process in real-time. In our study, we review the types of process defects that can be monitored via process signatures captured by in situ sensing devices and recent advancements in the field of data analytics for easy and automated defect detection. We also discuss the working principles of the most common in situ sensing sensors to have a better understanding of the process. Commercially available in situ monitoring devices on laser powder bed fusion systems are also reviewed. This review is inspired by the work of Grasso and Colosimo, which presented an overall review of powder bed fusion technology.},

Two main method developments are discussed. The first is a mixed interface-capturing/interface-tracking computational framework aiming to explicitly treat the gas-metal interface without mesh motion/re-meshing. The second is a physics-based and non-empirical deposit geometry model for DED processes.

Varieties of models have been developed with different assumptions and purposes, and these models are sometimes difficult to choose from, especially for end-users, due to the lack of quantitative comparison and standardization. Thus, this study is focused on quantifying model uncertainty due to the modeling assumptions, and evaluating differences based on whether or not selected physical factors are incorporated. Multiple models with different assumptions, including a high-fidelity thermal-fluid flow model resolving individual powder particles, a low-fidelity heat transfer model simplifying the powder bed as a continuum material, and a semi-analytical thermal model using a point heat source model, were run with a variety of manufacturing process parameters. Experiments were performed on the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Additive Manufacturing Metrology Testbed (AMMT) to validate the models. A data analytics-based methodology was utilized to characterize the models to estimate the error distribution. The cross comparison of the simulation results reveals the remarkable influence of fluid flow, while the significance of the powder layer varies across different models. This study aims to provide guidance on model selection and corresponding accuracy, and more importantly facilitate the development of AM models.},

Influences from partial melting and laser-powder interaction are also addressed. We then perform 3D finite element non-isothermal phase-field simulations of the SLS single scan. To confront the high computation cost, we propose a novel algorithm analogy to minimum coloring problem and manage to simulate a system of 200 grains with grain tracking algorithm using as low as 8 non-conserved order parameters. Specifically, applying the model to SLS of the stainless steel 316L powder, we identify the influences of laser power and scan speed on microstructural features, including the porosity, surface morphology, temperature profile, grain geometry, and densification. We further validate the first-order kinetics of the transient porosity during densification, and demonstrate the applicability of the developed model in predicting the linkage of densification factor to the specific energy input during SLS.},

Prior methods are naturally developed and highly experience-dependent, which falls short for its objectiveness and transferability. In this paper, a decision support system (DSS) framework for automatically determining the candidacy of a part or assembly for AM applications is proposed based on machine learning (ML) and carefully selected candidacy criteria. With the goal of supporting efficient candidate screening in the early conceptual design stage, these criteria are further individually decoded to decisive parameters which can be extracted from digital models or resource planning databases. Over 200 existing industrial examples are manually collected and labelled as training data; meanwhile, multiple regression algorithms are tested against each AM potential to find better predictive performance. The proposed DSS framework is implemented as a web application with integrated cloud-based database and ML service, which allows advantages of easy maintenance, upgrade, and retraining of ML models. Two case studies of a hip implant and a throttle pedal are used as demonstrating examples. This preliminary work provides a promising solution for lowering the requirements of non-AM experts to find suitable AM candidates.},

In the present work, three levels of surface oxide concentration were prepared on AM-grade 316L stainless steel powders, and their melting and solidification behavior was systematically studied through               in-situ               observation, advanced characterization, phase-field modeling, and theoretical analysis. Si, Mn, and Cr participated in the oxidation reaction in powder with low and medium oxygen contents, whereas Fe was involved in the oxidation reaction for the powder samples with high oxygen content. A higher full melting temperature is observed to lead to an integrated melt pool in the melting of the highly oxidized powder, which is due to the reduced permeability produced by the oxide cage effect. For the droplet samples prepared from high oxygen powders, the inclusion with increased volume fraction and coarsened size is attributed to the agglomeration of inclusion particles with the residual oxide in the melt. In the high oxygen powder fusion scenario, an undesired coarse columnar grain structure with a high aspect ratio is formed in the current nonequilibrium solidification process, and a consistent microstructure is predicted using solidification conditions with a high cooling rate and high thermal gradient similar to the conventional AM process. In contrast, fine equiaxed grains in the experiment and slim columnar grains with a small aspect ratio in the phase-field simulation are obtained for the low oxygen powder condition. This study illustrates the effect of powder oxide from a processing aspect and provides insight into the importance of improving the service life of powder feedstock by effectively reducing the surface oxidation process on the powder surface.},

  abstract = {Selective Laser Melting (SLM) or laser beam powder bed fusion of metals (PBF-LB/M) is a promising technology to fabricate metallic components with complex geometries. However, determining process windows for specific materials and SLM machines by trial-and-error experiments is time consuming and expensive. Numerical simulation has been demonstrated as an efficient way to aid the process development. A crucial aspect in simulating SLM is the absorption and reflection of the laser heat source by the material. While there exist elaborated ray tracing approaches and absorption models, the most important drawback is to measure a reliable reflection coefficient of the material for different temperatures and phases. In this work, we discuss the application of a laser beam absorption model for SLM of metal alloys in the high temperature regime. The model bases on fundamental physical laws by taking reflection, refraction and absorption into account. The corresponding reflection coefficient is related to other physical quantities, like the electrical resistivity, which are easier to measure. The computed reflection coefficients by this model are compared with reflection coefficient measurements of liquid NiFe alloys and with SLM of SS316L and Ti-6Al-4V. Finally, the laser beam absorption model is implemented in SAMPLE,2D,2D a software for simulation of additive manufacturing on the powder scale, and is exemplary applied on single track melting experiments on compact Ti-6Al-4V plates.

  abstract = {The understanding of rapid solidification behaviour, e.g. the undercooling versus growth velocity relationship, is crucial for tailoring microstructures and properties in metal alloys. In most rapid solidification processes, such as additive manufacturing (AM), in situ investigation of rapid solidification behaviour is missing because of the lack of accurate measurement of the cooling rate and nucleation undercooling. In the present study, rapid solidification of single micro-sized Al-Si12 (mass\%) particles of various diameters has been investigated via differential fast scanning calorimetry employing controllable cooling rates from 100 to 90,000~K~s-1 relevant for AM. Based on nucleation undercooling and on microstructure analysis of rapidly solidified single powder particles under controlled cooling rates, two different heterogeneous nucleation mechanisms of the primary {$\alpha$}-Al phase are proposed. Surface heterogeneous nucleation dominates for particles with diameter smaller than 23~{$\mu$}m. For particles with diameter larger than 23~{$\mu$}m, the nucleation of the primary {$\alpha$}-Al phase changes from surface to bulk heterogeneous nucleation with increasing cooling rate. The results indicate that at large undercoolings ({$>$}\,95~K) and high cooling rates ({$>$}\,10,000~K~s-1), rapid solidification of single particle can yield a microstructure similar to that formed in AM. The present work not only proposes new insight into rapid solidification processes, but also provides a theoretical foundation for further understanding of microstructures and properties in additively manufactured materials.},

In this study, a phase-field (PF) model is developed to simulate the grain evolution of TiB2/316L stainless steel composite during the selective laser melting (SLM) process. The reinforcing TiB2 particles are explicitly incorporated into the PF model, and the influences on grain evolutions are comprehensively considered, including the induced heterogeneous nucleation and the pinning effect on grain boundaries. The simulation results demonstrate that with the addition of TiB2 particles, both columnar and equiaxed grains are formed in the scanning track. While the columnar grains are due to epitaxial growth from the molten pool boundary, the TiB2 particles act as the nucleation sites inside the molten pool, resulting in the formation of equiaxed grains. The grain boundaries become complicated due to the pinning of grain boundaries by TiB2 particles. As the content of TiB2 particles increases, the grain size decreases and the equiaxed grains are closer to the fusion boundary of the scanning track, which are attributed to the increasing nucleation sites and the retarded grain growth during solidification. In addition, the grain coarsening in previous layers is restrained due to the Zener pinning effect. The simulated grain morphology and the predicted influence trend of the TiB2 content on grain morphology are in good agreement with the experimental observations in the literature.},

  abstract = {A thermodynamically consistent phase-field model is developed to study the non-isothermal grain coalescence during the sintering process, with a potential application to the simulation in unconventional sintering techniques, e.g. spark plasma sintering, field-assisted sintering, and selective laser sintering, where non-equilibrium and high temperature gradient exist. In the model, order parameters are adopted to represent the bulk and atmosphere/pore region, as well as the crystallographic orientations. Based on the entropy analysis, the temperature-dependent free energy density is developed, which includes contributions from the internal energy (induced by the change of temperature and order parameters) and the order parameter related configurational entropy. The temperature-dependent model parameters are determined by using the experimental data of surface and grain boundary energies and interface width. From laws of thermodynamics, the kinetics for the order parameters and the order-parameter-coupled heat transfer are derived. The model is numerically implemented by the finite element method. Grain coalescence from two identical particles shows that non-isothermal condition leads to the unsymmetric morphology and curved grain boundary due to the gradients of on-site surface and grain-boundary energies induced by the local temperature inhomogeneity. More simulations on the non-isothermal grain coalescence from two non-identical and multiple particles present the temporal evolution of grain shrinkage/growth, neck growth, and porosity, demonstrating the capability and versatility of the model. It is anticipated that the work could provide a contribution to the research community of unconventional sintering techniques that can be used to model the non-isothermal related microstructural features.},

The formation of spatter in SLM depends on the process parameters, and these can potentially be used to tune the process to obtain better product quality. However, there is still a lack of efficient methods for processing spatter images to allow in situ detection of the onset of spatter. In this paper, an in situ monitoring method for acquiring spatter images in SLM was presented. A maximum-entropy double-threshold image processing algorithm based on genetic algorithm (MEDTIA-GA) was proposed to recognize spatter from images, and its results were compared with three conventional threshold segmentation methods: Otsu's method, Triangle threshold segmentation algorithm, and K-means clustering algorithm. Results show that MEDTIA-GA method was able to eliminate three types of errors: noise sensitivity, spatter conglutination, and spatter omission. In addition, the average processing time of 37 ms for MEDTIA-GA method was far shorter than those for other three conventional threshold segmentation methods. Finally, the relationship between the spatter area as well as the number and the laser energy density were analyzed},

A constitutive law relating melt pool geometry to the process parameters thereby plays an essential role in practically fostering machine productivity and component quality in LPBF. In this work, we derive an enhanced dimensionless scaling law based on dimensional analysis to characterize the melt pool width, which is also capable in scaling the beam-size-dependent laser attenuation. Measurements from LPBF-produced specimens and 3D phenomenological LPBF finite element simulations are also performed in batch to validate the derived law. The regression analysis presents the correlation {$\sim$}97-98\% for the simulated melt pool widths and {$\sim$}70-90\% for experimental measured ones, with fabricated minimum strut thickness of 113 {$\mu$}m. After scaling the effective laser power with the calibrated laser attenuation, the proposed scaling law can be extended to be beam-size independent, as demonstrated by the regression of overall experimental measurements and simulation results, performed under different laser beam diameter, to the unified law with correlation {$\geq$}97\%. It demonstrates the feasibility of proposed scaling law in melt pool controlled LPBF manufacturing for designing and producing thin-walled components with strut thicknesses in the micrometer range.},

The undissolved Zr particle induced stress accumulation near the particle interface that affected the local shear behavior in the {$\beta$} dendrite and promoted slip bands multiplication. The inhomogeneous distribution of amorphous phase divided the BMGC into strong and weak domains and caused strain partition, leading to back stress strain hardening of the BMGC. It is also found that there exist dispersed {$\omega$} particles and {$\omega$} laths in the primary {$\beta$} dendrites during the L-PBF and the deformation process, respectively, leading to high strength but limited plasticity of the BMGC. Further improving the mechanical properties of the BMGC can be achieved by hindering the {$\omega$} formation through alloying method.

  abstract = {The use of video-imaging data for in-line process monitoring applications has become more and more popular in the industry. In this framework, spatio-temporal statistical process monitoring methods are needed to capture the relevant information content and signal possible out-of-control states. Video-imaging data are characterized by a spatio-temporal variability structure that depends on the underlying phenomenon, and typical out-of-control patterns are related to the events that are localized both in time and space. In this paper, we propose an integrated spatio-temporal decomposition and regression approach for anomaly detection in video-imaging data. Out-of-control events are typically sparse spatially clustered and temporally consistent. Therefore, the goal is to not only detect the anomaly as quickly as possible ("when") but also locate it ("where"). The proposed approach works by decomposing the original spatio-temporal data into random natural events, sparse spatially clustered and temporally consistent anomalous events, and random noise. Recursive estimation procedures for spatio-temporal regression are presented to enable the real-time implementation of the proposed methodology. Finally, a likelihood ratio test procedure is proposed to detect when and where the hotspot happens. The proposed approach was applied to the analysis of video-imaging data to detect and locate local over-heating phenomena ("hotspots") during the layer-wise process in a metal additive manufacturing process.},

Compared with large amount of previous work on powder spreading on a flat substrate surface before printing, in this article, 3D particulate scale dynamic simulations were carried out to study the spreading of 316~L stainless steel powder during printing by using discrete element method (DEM). The influences of various factors including processing parameters, blade shape, and the powder size on the quality of the spread powder bed were investigated in terms of both macroscopic packing density/uniformity and microstructure/micro dynamics. And optimized condition was identified. The mechanisms were also analyzed based on the powder behavior and forces caused by cooperative interaction between the formed zone (printed part) and the already packed powder layer. The results show that the blade moving speed can seriously influence the quality of the spread powder bed; normally the smaller the blade moving speed, the higher the powder bed quality, but the lower the working efficiency. Therefore, through comprehensive consideration, the proper blade moving speed is chosen to be 0.1~m/s. Increasing the blade gap height or decreasing the particle size (i.e., D =~30~\textmu m) will increase the average relative packing density and structure uniformity. The angle of 15\textdegree{} for the blade is proved to be optimal for excellent powder spreading. Through simulation under optimized parameters, it can be found that the spread powder layer can be more uniform and much denser with high efficiency. And both macroscopic and microscopic analyzes indicate that the spread powder bed has desired structure and property. These findings can improve the fundamental understanding on the powder spreading and provide valuable references for the formation of high quality powder bed during 3D printing.},

In pursuit of this goal, the objective of this work is to develop and verify a graph theory-based approach for predicting the heat flux in metal AM parts. This objective is consequential to overcome the current poor process consistency and part quality in AM. One of the main reasons for poor part quality in metal AM processes is ascribed to the heat flux in the part. For instance, constrained heat flux because of ill-considered part design leads to defects, such as warping and thermal stress-induced cracking. Existing non-proprietary approaches to predict the heat flux in AM at the part-level predominantly use mesh-based finite element analyses that are computationally tortuous \textemdash{} the simulation of a few layers typically requires several hours, if not days. Hence, to alleviate these challenges in metal AM processes, there is a need for efficient computational thermal models to predict the heat flux, and thereby guide part design and selection of process parameters instead of expensive empirical testing. Compared to finite element analysis techniques, the proposed mesh-free graph theory-based approach facilitates layer-by-layer simulation of the heat flux within a few minutes on a desktop computer. To explore these assertions we conducted the following two studies: (1) comparing the heat diffusion trends predicted using the graph theory approach, with finite element analysis and analytical heat transfer calculations based on Green's functions for an elementary cuboid geometry which is subjected to an impulse heat input in a certain part of its volume, and (2) simulating the layer-by-layer deposition of three part geometries in a laser powder bed fusion metal AM process with: (a) Goldak's moving heat source finite element method, (b) the proposed graph theory approach, and (c) further comparing the heat flux predictions from the last two approaches with a commercial solution. From the first study we report that the heat flux trend approximated by the graph theory approach is found to be accurate within 5\% of the Green's functions-based analytical solution (in terms of the symmetric mean absolute percentage error). Results from the second study show that the heat flux trends predicted for the AM parts using graph theory approach agrees with finite element analysis with error less than 15\%. More pertinently, the computational time for predicting the heat flux was significantly reduced with graph theory, for instance, in one of the AM case studies the time taken to predict the heat flux in a part was less than 3 minutes using the graph theory approach compared to over 3 hours with finite element analysis. While this paper is restricted to theoretical development and verification of the graph theory approach for heat flux prediction, our forthcoming research will focus on experimental validation through in-process sensor-based heat flux measurements.}

  abstract = {The goal of this work is to predict the effect of part geometry and process parameters on the instantaneous spatiotemporal distribution of temperature, also called the thermal field or temperature history, in metal parts as they are being built layer-by-layer using additive manufacturing (AM) processes. In pursuit of this goal, the objective of this work is to develop and verify a graph theory-based approach for predicting the temperature distribution in metal AM parts. This objective is consequential to overcome the current poor process consistency and part quality in AM. One of the main reasons for poor part quality in metal AM processes is ascribed to the nature of temperature distribution in the part. For instance, steep thermal gradients created in the part during printing leads to defects, such as warping and thermal stress-induced cracking. Existing nonproprietary approaches to predict the temperature distribution in AM parts predominantly use mesh-based finite element analyses that are computationally tortuous\textemdash the simulation of a few layers typically requires several hours, if not days.

For instance, for one of the AM part geometries studied, the temperature trends were predicted in less than 18 min within 10\% error using the graph theory approach compared with over 180 min with finite element analyses.

In the present paper the graph theory approach is validated with in-situ infrared thermography data in the context of the laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) additive manufacturing process. We realize this objective through the following three tasks. First, two types of test parts (stainless steel) are made in two corresponding build cycles on a Renishaw AM250 LPBF machine. The intent of both builds is to influence the thermal history of the part by changing the cooling time between melting of successive layers, called interlayer cooling time. Second, layer-wise thermal images of the top surface of the part are acquired using an in-situ a priori calibrated infrared camera. Third, the thermal imaging data obtained during the two builds were used to validate the graph theory-predicted surface temperature trends. Furthermore, the surface temperature trends predicted using graph theory are compared with results from finite element analysis. As an example, for one the builds, the graph theory approach accurately predicted the surface temperature trends to within 6\% mean absolute percentage error, and approximately 14 Kelvin root mean squared error of the experimental data. Moreover, using the graph theory approach the temperature trends were predicted in less than 26 minutes which is well within the actual build time of 171 minutes.}

  abstract = {Despite its potential to overcome the design and processing barriers of traditional subtractive and formative manufacturing techniques, the use of laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) metal additive manufacturing is currently limited due to its tendency to create flaws. A multitude of LPBF-related flaws, such as part-level deformation, cracking, and porosity are linked to the spatiotemporal temperature distribution in the part during the process. The temperature distribution, also called the thermal history, is a function of several factors encompassing material properties, part geometry and orientation, processing parameters, placement of supports, among others. These broad range of factors are difficult and expensive to optimize through empirical testing alone. Consequently, fast and accurate models to predict the thermal history are valuable for mitigating flaw formation in LPBF-processed parts. In our prior works, we developed a graph theory-based approach for predicting the temperature distribution in LPBF parts. This mesh-free approach was compared with both non-proprietary and commercial finite element packages, and the thermal history predictions were experimentally validated with in-situ infrared thermal imaging data. It was found that the graph theory-derived thermal history predictions converged within 30\% to 50\% of the time of non-proprietary finite element analysis for a similar level of prediction error. However, these prior efforts were based on small prismatic and cylinder-shaped LPBF parts. In this paper, our objective was to scale the graph theory approach to predict the thermal history of large volume, complex geometry LPBF parts. To realize this objective, we developed and applied three computational strategies to predict the thermal history of a stainless steel (SAE 316L) impeller having outside diameter 155mm and vertical height 35mm (700 layers). The impeller was processed on a Renishaw AM250 LPBF system and required 16hours to complete. During the process, in-situ layer-by-layer steady state surface temperature measurements for the impeller were obtained using a calibrated longwave infrared thermal camera. As an example of the outcome, on implementing one of the three strategies reported in this work, which did not reduce or simplify the part geometry, the thermal history of the impeller was predicted with approximate mean absolute error of 6\% (standard deviation 0.8\%) and root mean square error 23K (standard deviation 3.7K). Moreover, the thermal history was simulated within 40minutes using desktop computing, which is considerably less than the 16hours required to build the impeller part. Furthermore, the graph theory thermal history predictions were compared with a proprietary LPBF thermal modeling software and non-proprietary finite element simulation. For a similar level of root mean square error (28K), the graph theory approach converged in 17minutes, vs. 4.5hours for non-proprietary finite element analysis.},

It is often the case that a suite of hierarchically linked (or coupled) simulation models is needed to achieve the above task, as the entirety of the complex physical phenomena relevant to the understanding of process-structure-property-performance relationships in the context of AM precludes the use of a single simulation framework. In this study using a Bayesian network approach, we address the important problem of conducting uncertainty quantification (UQ) analysis for multiple hierarchical models to establish process-microstructure relationships in laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) AM. More significantly, we present the framework to calibrate and analyze simulation models that have unmeasurable variables, which are quantities of interest predicted by an upstream model and necessary for the downstream model in the chain that are difficult or impossible to observe experimentally. We validate the framework using a case study on predicting the microstructure of binary nickel-niobium alloys processed using LPBF as a function of processing parameters. Our framework is shown to be able to predict segregation of niobium with up to 94.3\% prediction accuracy in test data.},

Critical quality issues such as porosity, surface roughness, crack, and delamination continue to present challenges within SLM-manufactured parts. Monitoring and in-process defect diagnosis are the key to improving the final part quality. Currently, it greatly hinders the adaptability and the development within the defect detection system since the setup restricts the vision and photo diode applications in the SLM process monitoring. Additionally, defect detection with traditional classification approaches makes the system rather complex due to introducing a series of steps. To meet these needs, this study proposes a novel method for the defect detection within the SLM parts. The setup was flexibly conducted using a microphone, and the defect detection was obtained by the framework of deep belief network (DBN). It is implemented by a simplified classification structure without signal preprocessing and feature extraction. The experimental results showed that the utilization of acoustic signals was workable for quality monitoring, and the DBN approach could reach high defect detection rate among five melted states without signal preprocessing.},

Selective Laser Additive Manufacturing using elemental powders of Titanium and Boron provides a transforming technology for the application of TiB2 by enabling its 3D free forming capability. In this paper, to investigate the joint effects of selective laser melting and chemical reactions in the Selective Laser Alloying (SLA) process, a numerical based simulation was conducted using COMSOL Multiphysics 5.4. This is the first successful numerical study of melting and reaction in the selective laser alloying process providing details about the molten pool. The influences of the evolution of free solid-liquid interface, species transport, the chemical reaction rate, and the evaporation latent heat were discussed by considering the production of TiB2 and its concentration distribution in the computational domain. The simulation results show that the melting front of the free surface has a relatively high velocity, at the instant when the powder particles melt, the first speed jump will occur, and when the reaction is triggered, the second speed jump will occur; the heat released from the exothermic reaction between Titanium and Boron is an important energy source which can reduce the energy input and help improve the manufacturing efficiency of the SLA process; the evaporation latent heat also has a significant influence to the temperature field in the computational domain; the concentration distribution of TiB2 strongly relies on the chemical reaction rate and the diffusion coefficient. This study may blueprint a design strategy for the Additive Manufacturing research community by considering to adopt the proposed numerical model, predict the reactions and species concentration, and explore the structures of microscale molten pool and the macroscale defects or so.},

For instance, it has been well demonstrated that lack-of-fusion (LoF) pores  produced in the selective laser melting (SLM) AM process can significantly limit the fatigue performance of the material. Although two-dimensional (2D) models exist to  predict the 2D profiles of LoF pores, the 2D pore profiles cannot be directly inserted into a three-dimensional (3D) microstructure domain that is output from several  prevailing process simulation packages. A few commercial packages that simulate the SLM process can predict LoF pores in a 3D domain, but the morphologies of LoF  pores are voxelated and hence do not capture sharp corners of the pores, thereby obviating their use in fatigue crack initiation studies. In order to address the  aforementioned gaps, a high-fidelity model that predicts not only the volume fraction, but also the explicit 3D morphologies and spatial distributions of LoF pores has been  developed using a computer aided design-based environment. The model has been partially validated for Ti-6Al-4V alloy by comparing the predictions of the volume  fraction of LoF pores predicted by the model with experimental data obtained from the literature.},

However, its application has been hindered by the computational complexity of extended dynamic mode decomposition; this requires a combinatorially large basis set to adequately describe many nonlinear systems of interest, e.g. cyber-physical infrastructure systems, biological networks, social systems, and fluid dynamics. Often the dictionaries generated for these problems are manually curated, requiring domain-specific knowledge and painstaking tuning. In this paper we introduce a computational framework for learning Koopman operators of nonlinear dynamical systems using deep learning. We show that this novel method automatically selects efficient deep dictionaries, requiring much lower dimensional dictionaries while outperforming state-of-the-art methods. We benchmark this method on partially observed nonlinear systems, including the glycolytic oscillator and show it is able to predict on test data quantitatively 100 steps into the future, using only a single timepoint as an initial condition, and quantitative oscillatory behavior 400 steps into the future.},

The unstable state is characterized by numerous balling defects, where the bulk density is severely deteriorated. The transition state is featured by the transition region where the melt velocity is relatively lower, and the molten pool is vulnerable to the necking defect. The molten pool with a depression region is identified as the stable state. A small depression is favorable for improving the surface quality of single track and the bulk density. However, exorbitant energy input will convert the depression into a keyhole. Additionally, a threshold of the scanning speed was found, where the bulk density peaked. Over the threshold, the density decreased continuously with the speed increasing. However, the density slightly decreased by 1.5\% when the speed was below the threshold; this anomaly was ascribed to the residual pores induced by the recoil pressure.},

First, in situ video melt pool data acquired during LPBF is labeled according to the (1) average and (2) standard deviation of individual track width and also (3) whether or not the track is continuous, measured postbuild through an ex situ height map analysis algorithm. This procedure generates three ground truth labeled datasets for supervised machine learning. Using a portion of the labeled 10 ms video clips, a single convolutional neural network architecture is trained to generate three distinct networks. With the remaining in situ LPBF data, the trained neural networks are tested and evaluated and found to predict track width, standard deviation, and continuity without the need for ex situ measurements. This two-step approach should benefit any LPBF system ? or any additive manufacturing technology ? where height-map-derived properties can serve as useful labels for in situ sensor data.},

The SLM-processed HEAs presented a simple disordered face centered cubic solid solution with columnar grains growing along the building direction and exhibiting a {$\langle$}001{$\rangle$} preferred orientation. Dendritic-segregation, a common phenomenon occurring in as-cast counterparts was eliminated, thus providing a significant method to form a single-phase solid solution. The cellular structure in the columnar grains germinated perpendicular to the boundary of molten pools. In addition, dislocations induced by internal stress were observed. Accordingly, the SLM-processed Al0.3CoCrFeNiCu HEA exhibited superior microhardness and compressive strength. Finally, two types of defects were found in this SLM alloy, including irregular holes and hot cracks. The latter occurring on solid\textendash liquid interface of molten pool were retarded by grain boundaries and then turned into muti-branches. Nevertheless, no crack-free sample could be prepared even though the printing parameters were optimized to achieve a high relative density of 99.08\%, indicating this HEA was not suitable for SLM technology to prepare.},

Laser remelting (LR) is a process that after each layer is deposited, re-scan the deposition layer with the same slice data but without powder deliver, and it is often used during selective laser melting. Herein, LR process has been applied during the DMD process of a 17-4 PH steel to enhance the densification level and relieve the mechanical anisotropy. It is found that the thermal history, porosity and microstructural evolution are dependent on the LR energy density. Moreover, the roughness of top surface of the deposited layer and intralayer porosity decrease with increase of the laser remelting energy density. While for interlayer defects, there is an optimal LR energy density corresponding to the lowest interlayer porosity. Furthermore, LR process can enhance the holding time at high temperature, even sometimes heat the sample above Ac1, resulting in change in contents of austenite and carbide. In addition, LR process greatly dilutes the pre-solidified texture. It was also proved that the flat defects in-plane to the interlayer and the anisotropy of the crystallographic orientations are extremely harmful for the mechanical isotropy of the DMDed samples. Finally, sample manufactured with laser remelting at 15.0\,J/mm2 has the lowest porosity and most random crystallographic orientations resulting in near isotropous tensile strength, but the contribution of laser remelting to eliminate anisotropy in elongation is limited because of the interlayer defects.},

In the present work, we develop a multi-grid Cellular Automaton (CA) model for the dendrite growth. In this model, the interfacial area is further discretized into a child grid, on which the decentered octahedron growth algorithm is performed. The model is comprehensively and quantitatively verified by comparing with the prediction of analytical models and a published x-ray imaging observation result, proving that the model is quantitatively and morphologically accurate. After that, with the temperature gradient and cooling rate extracted from a finite-volume-method(FVM)-based thermal-fluid model, the model was applied in reproducing the dendrite growth process of nickel-based superalloy during a single-track electron beam melting process.

However, challenges fabricating Nitinol parts have limited the use of this alloy. Nowadays, additive manufacturing methods, specifically selective laser melting (SLM), are being used as an alternative to conventional methods for fabricating Nitinol specimens. Achieving a dense structure and controlling the transformation temperatures in such products have been among the most important challenges for several research groups. In the present study, fabrication of dense Nitinol parts by SLM together with control of their transformation temperatures is investigated with the main purpose of achieving pseudoelastic products at room temperature. For this purpose, the effect of process parameters on density, transformation temperatures, microstructure, hardness, and shape memory response are studied. The influence of process parameters on transformation temperatures varies depending on the amount of power so that the effect of scan tracks spacing for high powers is more pronounced than that for low powers. The hardness and compressive strength of the parts are also affected by the process parameters. Accordingly, optimal parameters are found to fabricate dense pseudoelastic parts with the ability of strain recovery at ambient temperature.},

In this study, a dual-phase AlCoCuFeNi HEA, consisting of body-centered cubic (BCC) solid solution matrix with uniformly dispersed face-centered cubic (FCC) structured precipitates, was fabricated by selective electron beam melting (SEBM). SEBM involved a preheating process can enable the formation of Cu-rich FCC phases with needle-like and spherical morphologies, as well as nanotwins that in-situ precipitated from the metastable BCC(B2) matrix. The compressive strength and ductility of the SEBM HEA were superior to those of the HEAs processed by selective laser melting (SLM) AM technique. Furthermore, using selective electron beam remelting (SEB-RM) during SEBM could result in a higher relative density, finer microstructure, and enhanced compressive properties. Particularly, the SEB-RM sample exhibited a better compressive strength of 2572MPa, a yield strength of 870MPa, and a strain of 18.3\%. The improved mechanical properties of SEB-RM samples could be ascribed to the refined grains and the formation of FCC precipitates, mostly along the grain boundaries.

  abstract = {Additive manufacturing, often known as three-dimensional (3D) printing, is a process in which a part is built layer-by-layer and is a promising approach for creating components close to their final (net) shape. This process is challenging the dominance of conventional manufacturing processes for products with high complexity and low material waste1. Titanium alloys made by additive manufacturing have been used in applications in various industries. However, the intrinsic high cooling rates and high thermal gradient of the fusion-based metal additive manufacturing process often leads to a very fine microstructure and a tendency towards almost exclusively columnar grains, particularly in titanium-based alloys1. (Columnar grains in additively manufactured titanium components can result in anisotropic mechanical properties and are therefore undesirable2.) Attempts to optimize the processing parameters of additive manufacturing have shown that it is difficult to alter the conditions to promote equiaxed growth of titanium grains3. In contrast with other common engineering alloys such as aluminium, there is no commercial grain refiner for titanium that is able to effectively refine the microstructure. To address this challenge, here we report on the development of titanium\textendash copper alloys that have a high constitutional supercooling capacity as a result of partitioning of the alloying element during solidification, which can override the negative effect of a high thermal gradient in the laser-melted region during additive manufacturing. Without any special process control or additional treatment, our as-printed titanium\textendash copper alloy specimens have a fully equiaxed fine-grained microstructure. They also display promising mechanical properties, such as high yield strength and uniform elongation, compared to conventional alloys under similar processing conditions, owing to the formation of an ultrafine eutectoid microstructure that appears as a result of exploiting the high cooling rates and multiple thermal cycles of the manufacturing process. We anticipate that this approach will be applicable to other eutectoid-forming alloy systems, and that it will have applications in the aerospace and biomedical industries.},

Meanwhile we present that the addition of both Ni and Ti can suppress the crack formation and enhance the formability of NbMoTa HEA, prepared by selective laser melting (SLM), without compromising the mechanical performance. Actually, the fracture is suppressed by the transformation of microcracks due to grain boundaries with low stacking fault energy (SFE) which can greatly improve the formability of HEAs while ensuring its high-temperature performance.

Numerical solution of hyperbolic conservation laws has been a very important and challenging task with some difficulties such as nonphysical solutions, solution discontinuities and shock wave capturing, and a large amount of conventional numerical solvers of finite difference, finite volume and discontinuous Galerkin types have been developed in the past decades. Along with the booming and great success of deep learning in computer vision and natural language processing, many excellent works also have emerged for their application to PDE related scientific problems in recent years. In this paper, we propose a deep learning method for solving scalar hyperbolic conservation laws. More specifically, we design a neural network model in the unsupervised fashion, called ``IFNN'', based on a special implicit form for the solution of the problem. The proposed IFNN does not directly process the target PDEs, instead it deals with the nonlinear equations characterizing implicitly the solution of the PDEs. Numerical experiments and performance comparisons of our IFNN with the well-known PINN are performed on two well-known problems under various boundary conditions, the inviscid Burgers' equation and the Lighthill-Whitham-Richards (LWR) model for traffic flow, and the results show that IFNN can significantly outperform PINN in capturing the shock waves.},

Based on the SEM and TEM results, Er addition exists in the form of unmelted particles and Al3Er of sub-micrometer scale. The Er particles in the molten pool deteriorate the fluidity and result in higher porosity.

In this study, a FeCoNiCr high-entropy alloy was used as the strengthening phase to improve the performance of austenitic stainless steel processed via laser powder bed fusion. The microstructure of the as-printed parts was composed of high-entropy alloy nanoparticles, a solid solution matrix, and high-density dislocations. The strengthening effect caused by the microstructures resulted in a tensile strength of 627\,MPa with a maximum elongation of 50\%. The semi-obstructive effect of the interface on the dislocations improved the ductility, as proved through molecular dynamics analysis. The Cr, Ni, and Co elements in the high-entropy alloy melted into the stainless-steel matrix, facilitating the formation of a passive film; this improved the corrosion resistance of the composite. Thus, simultaneous improvements in strength, ductility, and corrosion resistance of the stainless-steel composites were realized. The composites inherited the performance characteristics of high-entropy alloys. This research also provides a new strategy to select the strengthening phase for composite materials. High-performance high-entropy alloy particles with lattice structures and element types similar to the stainless steel matrix have substantial potential to be used as strengthening phases.},

Comparing to the conventional manufacturing process, LPBF offers more freedom on the shape complexity and hierarchical complexity. Even though the LPBF process has many advantages, there are still many constraints on LPBF. At the current stage, LPBF process still has a very high threshold for industrial application. It requires designers to have extensive knowledge of LPBF process to make the design manufacturable. The need for the automatic manufacturability analysis in the early design stage is essential. In this paper, a novel approach on analyzing the manufacturability of LPBF process is introduced. The machine learning model is developed to predict the manufacturability of LPBF. The unique dataset is established as the training examples. The proposed method achieves very competitive accuracy on analyzing the manufacturability of LBPF.

  abstract = {This work presents a novel modeling framework combining computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and cellular automata (CA), to predict the solidification microstructure evolution of laser powder bed fusion (PBF) fabricated 316 L stainless steel. A CA model is developed which is based on the modified decentered square method to improve computational efficiency. Using this framework, the fluid dynamics of the melt pool flow in the laser melting process is found to be mainly driven by the competing Marangoni force and the recoil pressure on the liquid metal surface. Evaporation occurs at the front end of the laser spot. The initial high temperature occurs in the center of the laser spot. However, due to Marangoni force, which drives high-temperature liquid flowing to low-temperature region, the highest temperature region shifts to the front side of the laser spot where evaporation occurs. Additionally, the recoil pressure pushes the liquid metal downward to form a depression zone. The simulated melt pool depths are compared well with the experimental data. Additionally, the simulated solidification microstructure using the CA model is in a good agreement with the experimental observation. The simulations show that higher scan speeds result in smaller melt pool depth, and lack-of-fusion pores can be formed. Higher laser scan speed also leads to finer grain size, larger laser-grain angle, and higher columnar grain contents, which are consistent with experimental observations. This model can be potentially used as a tool to optimize the metal powder bed fusion process, through generating desired microstructure and resultant material properties.},

In particular, a multi-scale approach, spanning from atomic, particle, to component levels, is employed. The simulations of sintered material show that sintered particles have lower mechanical strengths than the bulk metal because of their porous structures. Higher heating rate leads to a higher mechanical strength due to accelerated sintering rates. The average temperature in the powder bed increases with higher laser power. The predicted distortion due to residual stress in the AM fabricated component is in good agreement with experimental measurements. In summary, the model framework provides a design tool to optimize the metal powder based additive manufacturing process.},

In this study, a coaxial optical path with an enhanced optical transmittance is used for imaging the melt pool and its surrounding phenomena simultaneously. An experimental system was developed using a high-speed camera for coaxial observation of hot spatters in the SLM process. The problems of limited field of view and high measurement uncertainty of an off-axis process monitoring system are solved. For defocused and distorted spatter images, both a segmentation algorithm and an object detection method have been proposed and proved to be effective. It was found that the direction and strength of the local airflow field could be estimated via the curvature of the spatter trajectory.

Formation of MGs requires sufficiently high cooling rates to bypass crystallization, which results in their limited sizes by conventional processing routes such as casting. Laser additive manufacturing (LAM) technique is featured by high solidification rate that provides the potential for scalable fabrication of MGs. In this work, through high throughput laser single-track melting experiments, we studied the LAM processing window of a Zr41.2Ti13.8Cu12.5Ni10.0Be22.5 (at.\%) MG to achieve materials with near-full density and minimal crystallization. We observed different types of single-track features including cracking, lack-of-fusion, and partial crystallization under different combinations of laser processing parameters. To rationalize the processing-structure relationships during LAM of MGs, finite-element thermal modeling was performed to monitor the transient temperature evolution and site-specific cooling rate in the melt pool. Our work provides significant insight into the LAM protocol optimization towards fully amorphous, well-bonded, and dense MG coatings on dissimilar crystalline materials.},

  abstract = {The discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods have attained increasing popularity for solving the incompressible Navier-Stokes (INS) equations in recent years. However, the DG methods have their own weakness due to the high computational costs and storage requirements. In this work, we develop a high-order hybrid reconstructed DG (rDG) method for solving the INS equations on arbitrary grids. To be specific, the inviscid term of the INS equations is discretized by applying the third-order hybrid rDG(P1P2) method with a simplified artificial compressibility flux, while the viscous term of the INS equations is discretized by using the simple direct DG (DDG) method. A number of incompressible flow problems, in both steady and unsteady forms, for a variety flow conditions are computed to numerically assess the performance of the hybrid rDG(P1P2) method, which confirm its ability to achieve the optimal third order of accuracy at a significantly reduced computational costs. Furthermore, a detailed comparison of a variety of different reconstructed strategies is performed and presented. Numerical results demonstrate that the hybrid rDG(P1P2) method outperforms the rDG(P1P2) method based on either the original least-squares reconstruction or the Green-Gauss reconstruction for solving the INS equations.},

However, the relationship between atomic radius, solid solution strengthening and precipitation strengthening has not been discerned yet. In this work, CoCrFeNiX0.4 (X = Al, Nb, Ta, with an equi-atomic radius) HEAs were prepared by powder plasma arc additive manufacturing (PPA-AM) and evaluated for their mechanical properties. Compression and nano-indentation hardness tests showed that the HEA with Ta showed the best properties. The influence of atomic radius and solid solubility on solid solution strengthening was investigated and the main strengthening mechanism that determines the mechanical properties of the developed HEAs was analyzed. The results showed that (i) the CoCrFeNiAl0.4 alloy did not show any solid solution strengthening effect and that a clear relation between solid solution strengthening and atomic size was not observed; (ii) in both CoCrFeNiTa0.4 and CoCrFeNiNb0.4 HEAs, precipitation strengthening and grain boundary strengthening effects are observed, wherein the difference in mechanical properties between both the alloys can be mainly attributed to the formation of fine eutectic structure in CoCrFeNiTa0.4; and (iii) from the microstructural analyses, it was identified that, in the CoCrFeNiTa0.4 HEA, the location containing a fine eutectic structure is accompanied by the formation of low-angle grain boundaries (LAGBs), which is also the region where deformed grains gather, giving rise to improved mechanical strengthening.},

To start with, we construct a hyperplane in {$\mathbb{R}$}4 by fitting a local element density distribution in the 18 Elements Scheme, use its gradient to estimate the overhang angle, the directional-dependent overhang angle and formulate the corresponding constraints. Next, we propose a Horizontal Square Scheme and four support sets around the concerned element. The horizontal minimum length was controlled by forbidding the concerned element's density to be larger than the average density of the elements in one of the support sets. By combining these two constraints, the hanging feature is well suppressed. A new implementation scheme with an improved weight function is proposed to meet these element wise AM constraints well. To get high resolution structural boundaries with low computational efforts, this paper applies the multiresolution topology optimization (MTOP) method. The structural TO problem is solved by MMA. A number of numerical examples and AM experiments show the effectiveness of this method. The present approach works efficiently when the building direction is in slight misalignment with the vertical direction.},

One approach to address this issue is to parallelize multiple laser beams to increase processing flexibility. Recent research has studied, for instance, the improvements to mechanical properties of final products when using two or more laser beams in PBF-LB/M. However, some obstacles still need to be addressed involving the proximity of molten pools and their interaction mechanism. In particular, interactions between two close, parallel molten pools have not been fully understood yet. In this study, two lasers create two parallel-running molten pools with a small spatial offset in between. With different spatial offsets, experimental results reveal that besides the completely merged and completely separated regimes, there exists a new regime which yields periodic coalescence between the two molten pools. High-speed imaging shows two different mechanisms for the formation of such coalescence, what we denote as head-to-head and head-to-tail coalescence. By changing processing parameters including laser power and spatial offset, periodic structures with various wavelengths can be engineered using this dual-laser approach.},

The microstructure and mechanical behavior of the fabricated coupon were investigated. High-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy show the formations of second phases including body-centered cubic, Laves, and {$\chi$} phases within the face-centered cubic matrix phase. The volume fractions of all the second phases increase with the Ti content, with a concomitant enhancement in the hardness.

A detailed analysis of the contributions of various strengthening mechanisms suggests that the second phases are the dominant contributors to the observed hardening with the Ti addition.

Zhao et al. used high-speed x-ray imaging to take a detailed look at how keyhole formation connects to porosity in a titanium alloy. They found that instability at the keyhole tip drives pores away to get trapped in the solidification front. Understanding this process and the operating parameters under which it occurs provides a roadmap for avoiding porosity and building high-quality metal parts. Science, this issue p. 1080 Laser powder bed fusion is a dominant metal 3D printing technology. However, porosity defects remain a challenge for fatigue-sensitive applications. Some porosity is associated with deep and narrow vapor depressions called keyholes, which occur under high-power, low\textendash scan speed laser melting conditions. High-speed x-ray imaging enables operando observation of the detailed formation process of pores in Ti-6Al-4V caused by a critical instability at the keyhole tip. We found that the boundary of the keyhole porosity regime in power-velocity space is sharp and smooth, varying only slightly between the bare plate and powder bed. The critical keyhole instability generates acoustic waves in the melt pool that provide additional yet vital driving force for the pores near the keyhole tip to move away from the keyhole and become trapped as defects. Pores trapped during additive manufacturing are connected to acoustic waves generated by keyhole instability. Pores trapped during additive manufacturing are connected to acoustic waves generated by keyhole instability.},

Multiple factors eventually lead to the improvement of properties, such as densification behaviors, grain characteristics, texture and the precipitated phases. We firstly investigate evolution of the melt pool characteristics which are varied under different processing parameters and lead to different solidified microstructures, densification behaviors and corresponding mechanical properties. Meanwhile, the characteristics of melt pool can be predicted through the normalized enthalpy of input energy, which presents more credible relationship with the melt pool dimensions. To this end, the relative density is up to 99.88\% when the volume energy density and normalized enthalpy are combined used. Recrystallisation inhabitations induced by the added Sc and Zr is supposed after comparing the grain sizes under different conditions.

Especially in the manufacture of sizable components, detecting process changes in a real-time and accurate manner for potential corrective operations is crucial. This study aims to develop a feedback control system to reduce inconsistent part quality caused by heat accumulation differences. There are two significant challenges. 1) Thermal images suffer from a low signal-to-noise ratio. 2) Discrete local sintering information should be able to indicate the adjustments to the global temperature field. To tackle these challenges, a feedback model based on a multi-input neural network is proposed to evaluate the sintering status accurately by integrating the thermal history and process features. Subsequently, a layerwise feedback control strategy is proposed to process the discrete sintering status into the variation trend of part quality and ensure that the material has the desired thermal history during sintering. A controlled experiment is used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach compared with its traditional counterparts, and the result illustrates the elimination of differences in heat accumulation by the proposed method.},

  abstract = {The recent explosion of machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) shows great potential in the breakthrough of metal additive manufacturing (AM) process modeling. However, the success of conventional machine learning tools in data science is primarily attributed to the unprecedented large amount of labeled data-sets (big data), which can be either obtained by experiments or first-principle simulations. Unfortunately, these labeled data-sets are expensive to obtain in AM due to the high expense of the AM experiments and prohibitive computational cost of high-fidelity simulations. We propose a physics-informed neural network (PINN) framework that fuses both data and first physical principles, including conservation laws of momentum, mass, and energy, into the neural network to inform the learning processes. To the best knowledge of the authors, this is the first application of PINN to three dimensional AM processes modeling. Besides, we propose a hard-type approach for Dirichlet boundary conditions (BCs) based on a Heaviside function, which can not only enforce the BCs but also accelerate the learning process. The PINN framework is applied to two representative metal manufacturing problems, including the 2018 NIST AM-Benchmark test series. We carefully assess the performance of the PINN model by comparing the predictions with available experimental data and high-fidelity simulation results. The investigations show that the PINN, owed to the additional physical knowledge, can accurately predict the temperature and melt pool dynamics during metal AM processes with only a moderate amount of labeled data-sets. The foray of PINN to metal AM shows the great potential of physics-informed deep learning for broader applications to advanced manufacturing.},

A large number of nano-scale Al3(Sc, Zr) phases were precipitated and uniformly dispersed in the matrix, which effectively improved the mechanical properties and high temperature stability of the material. The samples were aged at an isothermal temperature of 350 \textdegree C for 8 h. After aging treatment, some of the low-angle grain boundaries were transformed into high-angle grain boundaries, which improved the hindering effect on dislocations. The mechanical properties of the heat-treated samples were excellent, with the maximum tensile strength and elongation reaching 510 MPa and 11\%, respectively. The samples were mainly fractured by a mixture of brittle and ductile cracking mechanism, with brittle fracture in the columnar grain region and ductile fracture in the equiaxed grain region. The equiaxed grains have better effects on the mechanical properties of the alloy than the columnar grains.},

  abstract = {Additive manufacturing enables in-situ alloying of multi-component materials for the development of novel and high-performance materials. Here laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) of SiC-reinforced 316L stainless steels metallic matrix composites (MMCs) for improved strength and wear resistance were investigated. The densification behaviour, microstructural evolution, crystallographic orientation and properties of the LPBF-processed MMCs with different SiC contents were systematically investigated. The formation mechanisms of pores and cracks are discussed. Microstructural observations reveal that the microstructure changes from equiaxed to dendritic with increasing SiC are related to the different temperature gradient and solidification rates. The SiC addition affects crystallographic orientation and causes grain refinement to 316L. In addition, micron SiC particles are refined to nano-scale after laser processing, which induces massive dislocations in the 316L matrix. The strength and tribological properties of 316L are significantly improved by SiC addition, in which the 9~vol\% SiC reinforced MMC reaches a high tensile strength of about 1.3~GPa, together with a low wear rate of 0.77~\texttimes ~10-5 mm3/Nm. The achieved strength and wear resistance are at the highest level among literature, and the underlying strengthening mechanisms are elucidated.},

  abstract = {The Laser Powder Bed Fusion (L-PBF) process is being adopted in different industrial fields. However, L-PBF currently lacks process reproducibility and quality. Hence, quality monitoring techniques need to be adopted in order to reduce the process variability and to ensure a high-quality process. Accordingly, this work proposes a quality monitoring approach based on machine learning which links the optical signal of a layer to the density of the final part. The approach consists of selecting relevant statistical features from optical data and validating these features by assessing their ability in predicting the different density classes of different products. Afterwards, the approach is compared to a new deep learning framework that allows predicting a part density from the corresponding raw optical signals. This comparison allows assessing the relevance of the identified statistical features. The proposed monitoring approach is applied on cubical specimens produced with different process parameters, and the results are then discussed and analyzed.},

  abstract = {The inevitably formed residual stress in the Selective Laser Melting (SLM) process leads to distortion, crack and even delamination of the workpiece. Single laser is commonly applied during SLM processing. However, its productivity is much lower than multiple lasers. In addition, the research of residual stress with multi-laser condition currently is limited in the open documents. In this paper, a three-dimensional (3D) thermo-mechanical model, with considerations of temperature dependent properties of Ti-6Al-4V, phase change and convective flow, is developed at first. Then, the numerical results of maximum temperature and dimensions of the molten pool are validated by available experimental data. Furthermore, a parametric study in regards to a series of scan strategies is investigated. According to the simulation results, the residual stress increases significantly when the laser number reaches four. The ``two-zone technique'' scan strategy decreases the equivalent residual stress by 10.6 \% compared to the successive scan strategy. With a shortening scan length, the residual stress first increases slightly, then decreases dramatically and attains the minimum when it is a quarter. Furthermore, for the multi-laser SLM process, carefully planning the scanning sequence and the sweeping direction to decrease heat concentration is beneficial in controlling the residual stress.},
